## CHANGES TO DEMOGRAPHICS OF REALMS ##
Algarve: {Alan/Hurufi}
	In 410 CE, the migrating Alans were granted residence in Lusitania, much to the ire of
	King Viriathus X. The Alans were ignored by their new king and shoved into the most
	southern region of Lusitania. When the Umayyads tried to conquer Lusitania in 929 CE,
	they were halted by King Martim Viriathus, but did manage to conquer the southern
	portion where the Alans resided. The Alans converted to Islam, but strong gnostic
	influences from the Manichaeism prominent in their native steppe homeland remained
	nonetheless. These mystical elements would become manifest when an Alan mystic known as
	al-Hurufi published his most significant work, the Eternal Book. The faith was adopted
	by King Attaces during the splintering of the Caliphate, and remains the faith of the
	Iberian Alans.
Achaia: {Rhomaion/Sabellianist}
	While doing research on Buddhism, I noticed that a lot of their conversion force was
	directed to the West IRL. Evidently Buddhism was actually quite popular in Greece and
	Alexandria in ancient times, and although it never became a predominant religion, it is
	believed to help give rise to other religious sects within Western religions. I decided
	just for funsies to add a Buddhist province in Euboia. I picked that one because it
	doesn't have any serious importance due to the fact that it's a crusader colony and the
	ruler is Catholic regardless. Since this encroaches on an already-weak Sabellianism, and
	Orthodox is rather sizeable as is, I decided a few provinces wouldn't be missed and I
	made Achaia and Kephallenia both Sabellianist.
Lade: {Norsk/Ragnarokric}
	I added another Ragnarokric realm in Siberia, and I was bothered by the little piece of
	Forn Sidric that reached the Atlantic coast. So I got rid of it and simultaneously
	weakened the very popular Norse religion.
Hordaland: {Norsk/Forn Sidric}
	Since Sowiloic is for the Germans and not the Norse, and since I was the one who made
	them Sowiloic in the first place, it makes sense to return them to their original faith.
	The interesting thing is...
Bergen: {Norsk/Catholic}
	... I thought it would be interesting if we added a different struggle in Norway instead:
	the Catholic Agder's influence over the North Sea is beginning to rise, and this new
	faith from Rome is beginning to sway people living in the south, and the trade center of
	Bergen already has a church constructed - of which the current Grand Mayor is a regular
	attendee. This poses some interesting consequences for the Forn Sidric king of Hordaland,
	as you can expect vassal relations will suffer greatly.
Lusitania: {Lusitani/Endovellican}
Dalmatia: {Romanus/Solar-Imperial}
Valentia: {Romanus/Mithraic}
Corsica: {Romanus/Mithraic}
Marakanda: {Tokharos/Mazdayan Buddhist}
