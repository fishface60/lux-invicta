- Static religions (non-heresies that start with few or no rulers, and thus have little or no
chance of survival):
	- Put more here!

- Apollinarism doesn't make sense as an Arian heresy, and is much closer to
Monophysitism. What I was thinking we could do is rename monothelite to
Eutychianist (the beliefs are quite similar between Monothelites and Eutychians),
and have Apollinarism and Eutychianism be the two heresies of Monophysitism, which
is closer to the real-life relationship between these sects and schools.


#:#:#LAYOUT MODIFICATIONS#:#:#

- Additional count characters that will make gameplay more interesting:
	- Put more here!


#:#:#BLOODLINES#:#:#

- Blood of Toramana: Consolidator of Huna power in the Kophes region, and created a legacy of pillage that
India will not soon forget. No timeline references or character history, yet.

- Blood of Rollo: Shay even made a character for the legendary founder of Normandy, and yet there is no
bloodline. I call shennanigans.

- Blood of Lu Bu: I... I... It's... Lu Bu!

- Blood of Ashoka: Famous Indian king (mentioned in the timeline) who eventually obtained Western Sindhian
independence from the hands of the Seleukids and implemented a series of social and religious reforms in
his realm before it yet again succame to Greek invasion.


#:#:#SPECIAL UNITS#:#:#

- elephants
	(African, Indian, no matter; they'll scare the shit out of just about anyone on the battlefield)
- horse archers
	(Most effective pre-gunpowder military unit)
- camels
	(Besides being able to survive on very little water, the smells and sounds camels make scare horses
	quite well)
- chariots
	(An ancient invention used by peoples all across the Old World, it's a lot like really heavy cavalry.
	What the horses don't trample the scythe blades and armed charioteers will slice to pieces.)
- chariot archers
	(A lot like horse archers, but with less mobility and more defense)
- war dogs
	(Many people used them, and a smaller foe going straight for the throat can be quite hard to hit.
	That being said, once released they tend to go batshit unless their handlers can regain control.)
- war beasts
	(Think midway between elephants and war dogs. They would be impossible to control and not as massive
	as an elephant, but baically just as fearsome. Think bulls, rhinos, lions, tigers; basically anything
	they'd put in an arena with a gladiator could be put on a battlefield with an enemy.)
- war machines
	(Any kind of large engineered device used to kill soldiers on the battlefield. This would differ from
	siege equipment in the fact that war machines are designed to target soldiers, whereas siege equipment
	is used primarily for knocking down walls, gates, and other defensive structures. Think Greek flamethrowers,
	scorpions, etc.)
