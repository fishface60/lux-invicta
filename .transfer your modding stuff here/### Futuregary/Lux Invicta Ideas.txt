#:#:#RELIGION#:#:#

- Static religions (non-heresies that start with few or no rulers, and thus have little or no
chance of survival):
	- Put more here!

- Apollinarism doesn't make sense as an Arian heresy, and is much closer to Monophysitism. I
was also kicking the idea of around of adding Eutychianism as a Monophysite heresy, perhaps
even replacing Miaphysite. The reason I say this is because it has a similar belief regarding
the nature of Christ. Eutychianists believe that Christ had a human nature but it was
overcome by a divine nature to create a blend between the two. Miaphysites believe Christ
had both a divine and human nature, coexisting as one, without confusion. Eutychianism has
an older feel to it that Miaphysitism does is the only reason I say this.

- New religion mechanics:
	- (ai_peaceful = yes): The replacement for the old "pacifist" mechanic, which now has a
	new function. This is inside the religion_group scope.
	- (ai_convert_same_group)/(ai_convert_other_group): Each can have a value of 0 (never converts),
	1 (tries to convert if ai_zeal is high), or 2 (always tries to convert). This is inside the
	religion_group scope.
	- (feminist = yes): Nullifies the negative opinion modifier that vassals normally get if ruler
	is female or has female heir.
	- (matrilineal_marriages = no): Disallows matrilineal marriage based on religion; basically
	Islam's mechanic exported for modders.
	- (priest_title): Not sure if it's new or if I just haven't noticed it until now, but it looks
	like now we can change the title for temple holders in the religions document.
	- (secondary_event_pictures): Still not totally sure what this does.
	- (expel_modifier): Now we can expel other religions? This might be something we can use... is it?
	- (piety_name): Yes, we can change the name for "Piety" for each religion. How awesome is that?!
	- (has_heir_designation): Religions which can choose their heir. We can definitely use this.
	- (peace_piety_gain): The natural opposite to peace_prestige_loss.


#:#:#LAYOUT MODIFICATIONS#:#:#

- Additional count characters that will make gameplay more interesting:
	- Put more here!


#:#:#SELIN#:#:#

- Vegetarian trait, with a minor health bonus, assigned for particular religions that...
well, feature vegetarianism as a doctrinal aspect. Maybe for a few others who choose the
lifestyle on their own. I see that a vegetarian trait has been added, though I don't know if
it's connected to SELIN in any way.

- Apocalyptic Soul! Extremely sectarian, horrible opinion modifiers, bonus from temple
levies, access to special CBs, and a special Apocalypse event chain. Suggested religions:
	- Add more here!

- Investiture allowed to Statist and Clerical religions.


#:#:#CASUS BELLI#:#:#

- Make it a decision whether or not to allow the former count of a newly-conquered province
(unless they are Duke-tier or higher) to keep their position.
- New religions have been created with this map expansion, and so have new civilizations to
go with them:
	- Chinese: characterized by unique technological advancements and the role of class and
	philosophy in daily life.
	- Saharan: characterized by a nomadic lifestyle based on trade caravans, wide spread of
	ideas but few permanent settlements.
	- Shamanic: characterized by small tribal communities with little connection to the
	outside world, typically led by a spiritual sage to interpret signs and the will of the
	gods.
	- Indian: characterized by an inherent caste system, aesthetic importance in religion,
	and a mysterious sensuality about everything. (This was just rewritten a bit to include
	the caste system.)


#:#:#BLOODLINES#:#:#

- Blood of Toramana: Consolidator of Huna power in the Kophes region, and created a legacy of pillage that
India will not soon forget. No timeline references or character history, yet.

- Blood of Rollo: Shay even made a character for the legendary founder of Normandy, and yet there is no
bloodline. I call shennanigans.

- Blood of Lu Bu: I... I... It's... Lu Bu!

- Blood of Ashoka: Famous Indian king (mentioned in the timeline) who eventually obtained Western Sindhian
independence from the hands of the Seleukids and implemented a series of social and religious reforms in
his realm before it yet again succame to Greek invasion.

#:#:#SPECIAL UNITS#:#:#

- elephants
	(African, Indian, no matter; they'll scare the shit out of just about anyone on the battlefield)
- horse archers
	(most effective pre-gunpowder military unit)
- camels
	(besides being able to survive on very little water, the smells and sounds camels make scare horses
	quite well)
- chariots
	(an ancient invention used by peoples all across the Old World, it's a lot like really heavy cavalry.
	What the horses don't trample the scythe blades and armed charioteers will slice to pieces.)
- chariot archers
	(a lot like horse archers, but with less mobility and more defense)
- war dogs
	(many people used them, and a smaller foe going straight for the throat can be quite hard to hit.
	That being said, once released they tend to go batshit unless their handlers can regain control.)
- war beasts
	(think midway between elephants and war dogs. They would be impossible to control and not as massive
	as an elephant, but baically just as fearsome. Think bulls, rhinos, lions, tigers; basically anything
	they'd put in an arena with a gladiator could be put on a battlefield with an enemy.)
