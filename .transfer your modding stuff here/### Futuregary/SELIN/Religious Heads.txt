**Currently in progress, not implemented**

Proposed new religious head system:
- Most reformed religions will have a chance to form their religious head, but only a few will exist at start.
- God-king religion heads will operate by trait/modifier mechanics and will only apply to a select few religions.
- All reformed Islamic religions will have their own caliphates that can be formed (only Sunni, Shia, and 'Ilm caliphates will exist at start up).
- Vassalizing a religion head will be an option available only to those who control three or more holy sites, have a lot of authority/piety, and a high opinion from the religion head.
- Religions that allow players to be the religion head will be hand-selected and differentiated from the others through formation mechanic.

***Changes to Pentarchy***
- All unreformed religions using the pentarchy have been removed with their reformed counterparts added instead.
- Removed Docetist, as it is the only religion in it's parent-heresy group (Nestorian) to use the Pentarchy.
- Removed Solar-Imperial, as it has been moved to the god-king list. It can still use the Pentarchy holy sites, of course.
- Added Marcionist, since it makes sense.
- Added Valentinian, since it's a heresy of Orthodox.
