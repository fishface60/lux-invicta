Coat of Arms Builder
By Measter

Before running the program, you must copy the contents from <ck2 directry>/gfx/coats_of_arms to the graphics subfolder of this program. If you don't do so, the program will not work.

To add a custom Coat of Arms Set, place a .coaset file in the /sets folder defining the graphics and colours to use. A .coaset file can be opened in any text editor.
