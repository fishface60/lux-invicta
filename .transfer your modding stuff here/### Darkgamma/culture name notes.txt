The "Tiudiskaz" should really be "Þiudiskaz", or "Þiudiskai"; The latter should be added if the intended meaning was approximate
to "Þiudiskai manniz" = "German men"; the former should be if the meaning was something like "Þiudiskaz mannaz" = "German
man". We could go full freaky with "Þiudiskō" as in "Þiudiska fulką" = "Deutsches Volk". I thus recommend "Þiudiskaz"
due to the fact that my earlier prediction of "Þiudiskas" was wrong as it was a genitive form where the nominative was used.
