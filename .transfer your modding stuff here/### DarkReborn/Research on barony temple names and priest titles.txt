So, some people at the LI post were talking about how all the priests are named "Priests" and all the temples are "Religious Districts of".
I've then taken to myself the task of searching the Webz and beyond for more or less accurate titles for most of the groups. This is flavour, 
and that is where I shine.

Mithraic:
Rel. head: Pater Patrum - highest grade in the Roman Mithras cults was Pater (Father, I know, it sounds Christian. Guess who adapted some Mithraic customs into their religion), so Pater Patrum (father of fathers) would be a theoretical central Mithraic authority
Priest: Pater - read above
Temple: Mithraeum - Place to worship Mithras, yup, that simple. And they were fucking everywhere, there's even one in a good state (though it has been reconstructed...) in my hometown, Zaragoza (Caesaraugusta).

Pyromantic:
Rel. head: NA
Priest: Pyraithoi - "Priest of Fire". Ironically, this is what the Greeks called the Zoroastrian priesthood. So ideal name for a syncretic Zoroastrian-Hellenic faith.
Temple: Pyraitheia - Similarly "Sanctuary of Fire". Hellenic name for Zoroastrian fire temples. Same deal than with Pyraithoi.
