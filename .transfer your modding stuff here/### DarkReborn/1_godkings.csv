GK01title;The Saoshyant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GK01desc;The Empire of Light has been restored! Persia has suffered under the yoke of many enemies: dangerous heretics and foreingers, all serving the decieving Daevas, and some even directly worshipping Angra Mainyu, the Destructive Spirit. The last remnants of the old Zoroastrian priesthood retreated into the heartlands and the ancient capital of Estakhr, and remained stagnant for long, but now, at long last, proper Zoroastrian rule over Persia has been restored.\n\nThis miraculous recovery can be attributed to your brilliant leadership, and there are many amongst the clergy who have decreed you to be the Saoshyant – the savior of the world that Zoroaster himself spoke of thousands of years ago. After embracing this role, you are now revered as a holy icon by Zoroastrians everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GK02title;The Ašto Akahe Maniauš;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GK02desc;The Realm of Eranshahr is ours! Persia has suffered much under the corrupt and doomed followers of Ahura Mazda and barbaric foreigners. Long ago Alexandros the Damned made these lands suffer under his terror campaign in the name of a deity of light, no doubt the false god Ahura Mazda or one of his servants, but we found salvation in the holy darkness of our new lord, Angra Mainyu! At long last, proper rule over Persia has been restored, and our message of salvation in darkness shall spread through the world! \n\nThis miracle can be attributed to your brilliant leadership, and there are many amongst the clergy who have decreed you to be the Ašto Akahe Maniauš – the harbinger of the Destructive Spirit, that was prophetised long ago in the fires. After embracing this role, you are now revered as a holy icon by the followers of Angra Mainyu everywhere!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
