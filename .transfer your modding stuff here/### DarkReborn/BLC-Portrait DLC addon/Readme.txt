LATEST CHANGELOG
v8d12+08
new headgear for Mithraic priests (again)n clothes
turkish portrait fix
updated BLC-DLC for indiangfx and turkishgfx (BLC-DLC now also requires Rajas of India and the Turkish Faces pack)
Added indiangfxcultures to graphicalculturetype.
Updated ancient semitic headgear (it should look more Canaanite right now... maybe it needs a bit more of Tyrian purple)
Integrated mongols face pack into BLC-DLC
Cutted down a lot of useless portrait slots down to size, from 20 headgears and 18 clothing to 15 of both (Christian priest clothings removed, emperor clothings have been merged with the first clothing slot and noble clothings 4 has been eliminated). This may result in a (honestly unnoticeable) more limited wardrobe but it's a huge performance improvement, both speed and RAM usage wise.
Filtered and dropped shadows on some pieces (they should look much better now)
New Hellengfx culture (basically, a ton of white exomis + linothoraxes for the military. Oh, and Megas Alexandros' Herakles lion scalp helmet for Emperors)
New Eastasiangfx culture, using a lighter variation of the most Asian looking parts of Crackdtoothgrin's steppe faces, with lighter skin tone, and a mix of my own work and rain005's on clothing and headgear, I'd say it looks pretty cool!! (Only sinohellenic+sinitic group cultures use it for now)
complete set of latin clothes, better quality latin headgear (New military headgear for Latingfx and better looking laurel wreaths for them)
Adapted the Turkish and Indian portrait packs in the BLC-DLC addon
Central Asian gfx culture; for Huns, Uyghurs and Bodpa.
Misc minor updates, mainly related to religious localizations and a fix to the northmangfx behind frames.
made a makeshift frontend_title and modified load_0 (the pre-load screen) until we get an artist to do an actual nice looking one. or we keep this if somehow people like it.
fixed northmangfx portraits' positioning. the damn 2.1.2 patch messing with my setup!
changes to chinese portraits
eliminated useless beards
all the southern (levantine, andalusian, oldbyzantine) gfx cultures now use modified versions of the muslim eyes for each of them to further differentiate them from northern (frankish, german, celtic, etc...) gfx cultures.
returned latin/mediterranean eyes to their former selves
Made the eastasiangfx eyes more Asian to further differentiate from Altaic and Turkish gfx cultures.
andalusiangfx (and persian, ancient semitic, etc...) females should look less spray-on tan and more natural tan.

Older Logs:
v8d12+07
- Added secondary graphical culture to some cultures so that they use the unit pack DLCs in case the player owns them.
- Added stepperomangfx for non-DLC Sarmatae (not as awesome as the BLC-DLC culture, but looks cool enough)
- Andalusiangfx females and others derived from it (that is, indohellen, ancient levantine, occitan, etc...) should now look as tanned as their male counterparts
- Some adjustments to the Turkish beards.
- Removed the Persian beards until I can rework them (honestly, they looked kinda strange)
- Fixed some problems with the steppe, cuman and indohellen portraits
- Afropgfx seems to have a problem I cannot identify; it causes portrait disappearing bugs. Changed Afrophoenicians to ancient semitig gfx ATM
- fixed the indohellen portraits crash

v8d12+06
- New military headgear for king tier latingfx (Bling of war - Late Roman edition!!!)
- New religious clothing for Mithras religions (Phrygian cap!!!).
- Made unisex the religious headgear. I was tired of editing essentially the same file twice.
- New headgear for Pagan priests ( I was tired of the Halloween skull hood costume, this one looks at least realistic, may not accurate)
- Thorough update of religious clothing. Including new priestly togas for the Graeco-Romans and new modest monk robes for the Buddhists.

v8d12+05
- integrated the base non-DLC-requiring files in the main LI installation. This file is now an optional file that enables DLC-requiring assets
- New headgear for Roman/Rhomaion/Hellen rulers; laurel wreaths!! Solar group emperor tier wear the Corona Radiata (Radiant Crown) as seen in depictions of Sol Invictus and some emperors in roman coins. Non solar emperor tier wear a golden laurel wreath instead. King tier wear normal wreaths. Dukes don't get any headgear (romans weren't actually that big on headgear).
- Made the "medieval galeas" darker.
- New martial headgear and clothes for latingfx. The clothes are from a late Roman general reenactor uniform replica and same for the helmet. The helmet had a very ornate mask but I removed it, might re-add it for the imperial helmet though.
- New martial headgear for latingfx... it looks kinda strange I know (the base was a costume-quality helmet image...), but I tried to make it look like a blend between late roman-ish and medieval helmet styles. If people think it looks goofy I might remove it.
- tweaked the Persian beard (the one the Sassanid emperor has)


v8d12+04
- New graphical culture for the Afro-phoenicians
- New headgear for the Indohellen portraits (Alan nomad style crowns)
- "BLC-fied" Northman gfx culture from the AGOT mod (used with permission and given credit properly) for the Visigoths (they should look slightly less barbaric) 
- Updated to lastest SCARRED version
- New headgear for the ancient Levantine cultures; Jewish, Nabateans and Syro-Arameans (Extracted/adapted from some Phoenician/Hebrew history illustration book sources I found)

v8d12+03
- DLC portrait cultures (Byzantine, Celtic, Norse and Russian) have their clothes and headgear updated to BLC standards.
- Most Altaic cultures (except Huns, Uyghurs and Mongols) use Crackdthoothgrin's Steppe Faces' hair, beards and headgear. Turks have a separate gfx culture.
- A lot of new gfx cultures made from combined DLC and BLC cultures material, such as the celtic-mediterranean galloromangfx or the norse-german teutonicgfx. 
- Brand new Persiangfx graphic culture, with beards and headgear put together by me with whatever skills I could muster.
- Latingfx (Romans & company) and Byzantinegfx (Hellens & company, except Indohellens) use Velorian's Modified Mediterranean faces. Other cultures (where appropiate) use Shaytana's original BLC mediterranean faces
- Most Semitic cultures except Berber, Andalusian, Jewish/Levantine and Saqaliba use Velorian's Modified Arab faces. The later 4 use the faces Shaytana made for them originally.

v8d12+02
Integrated the Modified Mediterranean GFX for LI Greek-sphere cultures and the Modified Arab GFX for certain arab cultures.	

v8d12+01
- Integrated cybrxkhan's Saxongfx for Central Germanic (germangfx) culture
- Integrated SCARRED by siroland  portrait graphics for some of the health/physical/illnesses traits)
- Integrated clothes from Crackthoothgrin's Steppe Faces
- New religious clothings (made from combined material from vanilla, BLC and Steppe Faces). There's plenty to use now but I plan to expand on this.
- Fixed some minor alignment issues here and there.
- No more rulers here and there wearing bishop cloth. I'm done with that stupid fashion trend.
