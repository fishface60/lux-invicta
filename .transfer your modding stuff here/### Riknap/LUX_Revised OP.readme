[COLOR="#FFD700"][size=4]CONCEPTS AND DOCUMENTATIONS[/size][/color]

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][b][u]MOD CONCEPT:[/u][/b][/color]

[i]Lux Invicta is an alternate history and gameplay mod. It's called Invincible Light because the original focus of my modding was centered on allowing me to play the two hostile "Realms of Light" - the Imperium Romanum worshiping Sol Invictus, and the Ahura Mazda worshiping Sassanid Eranshahr. You will also notice that the Light of Classical Antiquity has not been extinguished. Can you banish the Dark Ages?[/i]

--Shaytana

[size=1]
While Shaytana's words above describe the heart and essence of the mod, allow me to describe the "feel" and flow of the mod.
As compared to the settings of the large overhaul mods which indulge you with alternative settings, Lux Invicta instead takes a long hard look at our history's timeline, eyes the smooth mellow flavour that is vanilla and stares at the forbidden cabinet containing the toughest gaming condiments in the planet, and with the most manly man look asks that fateful question: 
"Will it blend?"

-- riknap
[/size]
(continuation of the mod concepts)
[spoiler][i]
A temporary quick description of the alternate timeline (for a detailed timeline scroll down to TIMELINE section):[list]
[*]the worship of Sol Invictus became the official religion of the Roman Empire and remained so in the East - where Imperial authority remained strong initially. Christianity did not gain a lasting foothold in most Roman controlled Eastern Mediteranean. The Eastern Empire became very anti-Christian.
[*]Christianity did thrive in the West and was adopted by a variety of invading peoples. Arianism is alive and well. Crusading happened earlier than in our reality, with several holy war initiatives aimed at the Eastern Mediteranean area. Several crusader states exist, from island realms to Jerusalem itself.
[*]Muslim expansion was not as succesfull as in real life - the Sassanids managed to stop them and survive. They were stopped in Northern Syria by the Romans, but managed to conquer most of North Africa - a notable exception being the Vandal Kingdom of Carthage. They did manage to establish themselves in Sourthern Spain but did not manage to thoroughly defeat the Visigoths - they are alive and well.
[*]General fragmentation /successor state syndrome - (partly because I dislike starting big, partly because I like to have many interesting playable options available) The Roman Empire (Eastern) is in tatters following rebellions/various cryses - and so is pretty much every other former power. You get to try to rebuild the bigger states, plus experience some very interesting (imho) smaller powers such as the Kingdom of Palmyra (a former long term vassal of the ERE) or the Exarchate of Ravenna.
[*]Alexander and company were more succesfull than in our reality. Hellenism was much more stubborn in its grip. The Diadokhoi managed to hold on to some areas and the world was changed forever.[/list]
 
As a general rule I concocted a logical timeline that lent itself towards the survival/appearence of interesting states and general fragmentation, with the potential for grand imperial adventures.

This mod is being developed for my own pleasure(as such many things both alternate-history and gameplay changes are done to suit my tastes), but if people are interested and offer good suggestions I am more than willing to alter things and expand some aspects etc. 

Any suggestions, requests, interesting ideas, feedback, etc, is greatly appreciated!

FOR FURTHER CLARIFICATION:

This is an alternate universe, with an alternate history. There is no "point of digression" per se. There are MANY differences going back into antiquity... such as Indohellenic survival, or a vassal state of Siracusa under the Roman Empire. When I started thinking about this timeline many years ago(and trust me I've given a lot of stuff a lot of thought over a period of years so some things are set in stone sort of -I had plenty of time over my university days where I studied history to come up with alternate history and research a lot of stuff) the alternate history started sometime before the very dawn of what we consider the historical period today.
 
My timeline has rhyme and reason, and research behind it -BUT- I am willing to make and I've already made some minor changes for pure fun and gameplay reasons (this so called 1066 scenario is a major compromise to gameplay), BUT those changes have to make sense and I have to be able to come up with a logical history behind how that stuff came to be given the general situation.

NOTE: I have caved in to my love for the Diadokhoi and gone a bit heavier on the Hellenistic side than I should have had, but hey it's fun and I've rethought some aspects of the timeline and setup for it. 

Disclaimer:

This is an early version so don't expect it to be perfectly polished! Even so I think the mod is very fun to play in its current state.

Note that the vast majority of counts are random generated -if you want to play one start as a playable character save->resign->load as the count.(or use play in console) Some characters are placeholders. Notice that there's quite a few claiming ancient descent from some famous dynasty...some are the real deal some maybe not...(I need to add some characters to history files and titles so everyone is not a no. I - that drives me crazy)

[u][b][COLOR="#FF8C00"]Gameplay Overhaul:[/u][/b][/color]
[spoiler]
[i]Gameplay in Lux Invicta is quite different from CK2 vanilla and will become ever more so in the future. Pretty much everything is changed or being changed under the hood of the game. Every update brings about new tweaks and changes. Because of the countless ongoing changes being made I will not be posting a detailed list until I reach 1.0 because otherwise I would spend more time writing changelogs than developing the mod. What you need to know is everything is being changed, yet if you pick up the mod you can still adapt very fast and have fun playing it![/i]

--Shaytana

Due to circumstance and partial necessity, most balancing and gameplay mechanic updates have been taken over by an associate module:
[url="http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?612823-MOD-Lux-Invicta&p=15464119&viewfull=1#post15464119"][b][COLOR="#008000"] Lux Invicta Buildings & Events, Retinues & Tactics, Traits & Technology Module[/color][/url][/b]
A simplified list of LIBERT3-tweaked modifiers, title requirements, CB rebalances, and such can be found in the [url="http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?612823-MOD-Lux-Invicta&p=16282339&viewfull=1#post16282339"]Calibration Coordinates[/url] post.

Because the LIBERT3 has ended up taking over the balancing part of the mod, most if not all relevant gameplay changes will be documented in the LIBERT3 portal post.

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][b][u]Religion Overhaul:[/u][/b][/color]
[spoiler]
[i]
My implementation of many religions needed further development and explanation... As such I present to you Numahr's epic work helping with this particular area: 
[url="http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?612823-MOD-Lux-Invicta&p=14159754&viewfull=1#post14159754"][COLOR="#008000"][b][/i]Spirituality Enhanced for Lux Invicta by Numahr[/b] [i](Read that post. Seriously. You will see why)[/COLOR][/url][/i]

--Shaytana

[/spoiler]

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][u][b]Buildings Overhaul:[/u][/b][/color]
[spoiler]
[i]The new buildings system is slowly being implemented and tweaked. The basic concept behind it is that each holding represents a region that happens to have an initial military/economic/or religious center. Each region is going to be able to build "regional" buildings while retaining a degree of specialization.

In order to build things you need to first increase your "control" over the region, then build up your administration. All of the many building lines, are tied together in logical fashion and allow for continous development of your provinces. Overall counting all implemented buildings for the 3 holding types there were at one point over 2700 buildings implemented -that number might be different /cut or expanded in the current build.

The new building system promotes differentiated cultural armies in various ways, from specific traditions and regional troops to a new liege and province system to a levy->professional->cultural elite corps military tied to liege culture. A select few legendary military traditions exist in some provinces, representing the very pinnacle of elite troops. Various religions also have their own versions of warrior cults.

Building up a professional military is a costly enterprise so you'd better make sure you have the economy to back it up.
[/i]
-- Shaytana

The buildings system has been further worked and refined since LIBERT3 was integrated in stages.

Currently*, buildings have been polished for both rebalance as well as deeper integration with technology and ruler/realm attributes/stats. For example, more advanced buildings require not only the prerequisite buildings but also advances in the relevant technology. This is to simulate advances in development that would allow "buildings" to be concieved and developed.
Others require not only these, but also a minimum level of a certain attribute to unlock (for the most part these are realm-attributes, so a subpar ruler could compensate with a skilled council) to simulate the plausibility of developing the relevant "buildings" in the first place.

In any case, there's a list of notes that I made (a WIP again for now) for quick reference: [URL="http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?612823-MOD-Lux-Invicta&p=14904091&viewfull=1#post14904091"][COLOR="#008000"][b]LIBERT3 Building Flowchart[/color][/b][/URL]

This list is still ... outdated really, especially with the TOG overhaul, but Sir Kulinski and I am working on a better and improved list and flowchart that could serve as easy reference.

*(at least prior to the TOG update)

--riknap

[/spoiler]

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][u][b]Events Overhaul:[/u][/b][/color]
[spoiler]
[i]
I believe that roleplaying your ruler is a very important aspect of fun gameplay. As such I will continue to add events to the game that allow you to roleplay your character. I have made (at the time of writing this) over 220 events that further this goal. They range from the infamous lunacy / possessed events (thank you Dune for inspiration) to historical flavor events, to various events that allow you to gain the new traits, to assassination events that can see your ruler killed off! Fortune favors the brave, and there is no greatness without risk!
[/i]

--Shaytana

Aside from Shaytana's original files, LIBERT3 also reinstates the vanilla files as well as incorporating and integrating applicable events from other mods, such as VIET and F&F.
As such, any information will also be included in the LIBERT3 development portal.

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][u][b]Casus Bellis Overhaul:[/u][/b][/color]
[spoiler]
Casus Bellis have received a significant overhaul to streamline the effect of authority as well as allow more fluid and dynamic gaming while still adhering to original design principles.

For simplicity as well as reducing the space in the OP, the comprehensive index of CB's can be found in the [url="http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?612823-MOD-Lux-Invicta&p=16282339&viewfull=1#post16282339"][COLOR="#008000"][b]Lux Invicta Calibration Coordinates[/b][/color].[/url]

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][u][b]Creatable Titles:[/u][/b][/color]
[spoiler]
Aside from de jure titles, there are a lot of creatable titular titles that are not only cheaper to create, but relatively significant lore-wise as well.

For simplicity as well as reducing the space in the OP, the comprehensive list of Creatable Titlescan be found in the [url="http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?612823-MOD-Lux-Invicta&p=16282339&viewfull=1#post16282339"][COLOR="#008000"][b]Lux Invicta Calibration Coordinates[/b][/color].[/url]

--riknap
[/spoiler]

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][u][b]Bloodline Biographies and History:[/u][/b][/color]
[spoiler][i]
I am implementing specific Bloodline Traits that provide a short biography and history of a dynasty and are meant to give you an overall feel of that particular dynasty/state. If you see a trait icon with a man on a golden/orange background hover your mouse over it to read the history in the trait tooltip. You can see an example here:[/i]
[spoiler]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/oT3hy.jpg[/img][/spoiler]

--Shaytana

Following some design principles, the AI effects of Bloodline Traits have been rebalanced in conjunction with the originally assigned bonuses (which themselves depend on the lore behind each dynasty bloodline), as well as being given general minor bonuses as well. With this, all important dynasties in the game (all of which are found in the Interesting Characters list underneath the Bookmarks) will play a greater role in Lux Invicta.

[/spoiler]

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][u][b]Notes Regarding Republics:[/u][/b][/color]
[spoiler]
[s][i]All playable republics start out as vassals. However, if you wish to play an independent state, it isn't hard to mod your desired republic to be independent. Making say Venice independent would be easy: edit history/titles/d_venice.txt and delete the liege line. If you want to eliminate the king and give the county to the doge, edit k_venice and change the holder line to holder = 0, and edit c_venezia.txt and give it the same holder as appeared in d_venice.txt.[/i][/s]

--richvh

Following some redesign and discussion, it has been agreed upon to make the state of republics dependent on their history, geography, and appropriety. For example, the merchant archipelago of Venice is a vassal of the Aurelian Realm of Venice situated in the Italian mainland, while Carthago Nova, a survivor and offshoot of the former maritime empire of Carthage (which itself still survives in its distant homeland), is an independent republic itself.

HISTORICAL TIMELINE 330BCE-200BCE:
[spoiler]
This is a temporary historical timeline, to be expanded upon and adjusted if needed:

330 BCE: Megas Alexandros conquers Persia. Beginning of implementation of policies regarding Hellenic Colonization of the East. Parmenion appointed Satrap of Ecbatana, his son Philotas sent to Media to oversee the creation of Hellenic military colonies in the region.

319 BCE: Megas Alexandros dies, poison is suspected to be the cause of his death. He leaves behind several legitimate children by Roxana and Stateira, and several ilegitimate ones widely acknowledged to be his.
