thanks for the feedback (as always, since I remember your posts before  ).
As for the Not at War thing, @Numahr or futuregary, what do you think? SELIN's your domain 
But yeah, the CB's themselves are my responsibility, and I've been looking to balance them lower since pre-TOG anyway
I think a malus of -1.0 would work just fine; perhaps a similar penalty for too few wives as well. If that's still too big, 0.75 is the lowest it should go IMO.


Regarding the authority for not at war malus, here is my understanding.
Presently they concern two types of religion:

- martial soul, for obvious reasons. Martial religions also get a very handy Sacred War CB which they can use easily. So I think, beside tweaking down the effect, nothing should be changed here.

- "tribal" civilizations, meaning Tengri, Norse, Celtic and all "Barbarian" civilizations (including German, Berber etc.). These simulates the fact that in these civilizations, the formalization of power structure is still partial, and so the different components of a given realm will give less authority to the ruler without the motivating factor of a war. As a balancing factor, all these religions get the ability to raid. 

So either you can use the sacred war CB, either you can raid. If you have the no war prestige malus but no access to sacred war CB or looting, then something is wrong... Otherwise I think the design is OK, even after 2nd thought... "Raid or kill some unbelievers, or else loose your authority!"

Note to riknap: since the sacred war CB of martial religions is an integral part of this malus' concept, as explained above, maybe it should be "lesser": less costly to activate, but so less piety gain. The idea then being that martial religions should be in some form of war by default, even if just for the sake of happily slaying some unbelievers...

2nd note after 3rd thought : if people (or AI!) find martial religions to hard because of this malus... then rather than removing it, we can think of other boosts to this soul to keep the concept, like increase further existing military bonii. But I would say, let's start with a tweaking of the martial soul-specific sacred war CB.
All those religions have what they need to prevent it from happening. The malus makes perfect sense for players, who should have to contend with expansion and war like that. For AI, who isn't smart enough to stay at war to the degree they need, it causes some problems.

We definitely shouldn't remove it, though. It's a vanilla aspect that makes perfect sense in this setting. I just think it should be reduced to functionable levels (if it ends up wiping out the Martial/Traditional religions, then it hasn't really done it's job anyway ).

While you're here, Numahr, I think there may be an issue with unreformed pentarchy religions; can they use both the reformation and pentarchy?

I am unsure yet of the exact conditions we can edit, but embarking on offensive war should come at a cost - depending on specifics - a war between clear religious enemies such as Zoroatrian vs Ahrimanist for example should not carry the same cost to declare as a war between not so clear enemies... Costs of casus belli should differ in terms of piety, prestige and cash... and some should come with negative oppinion hits...but all of this won't make it to version 0.1a because it would take too long to get right to begin with hehe. Also I should note that I want to eventually implement SERIOUS bonuses to fighting a defensive war. Conquering and holding onto stuff should be HARD. This mod will not have a set end date so I guess WC might eventually be achievable but it should be a TREMENDOUS achievement.



Also, let me raise my voice, strong and determined, against a too heavy-handed decrease of costs of CB due to popular pressure. If one looks back at the "old" files for CB, one sees that declaring war is by Shaytana's design supposed to be difficult, except for those specific CB granted to special religions. So while I am the one saying that sacred war CB should be made easily accessible, to balance the at peace malus... this is because this CB is only accessible to specific religions. Otherwise, the cost of CB is closely related to the fragmented nature of this world (as well as the high level of fortifications). LI's world is a world with different rules: OK you do not need a claim to declare war... but on the other hand this requires a strong political position at home as people are used to their little corner of valley and are reluctant to venture away from it, in these wild lands populated by people of a strange creed... so yes it may be ten years before you can declare war and conquer your first county, that is WAD!
I agree, CB costs shouldn't be lowered too much (if even at all, tbh); but as games have been showing, more than half the world has negative prestige within 20 years. By a lot. If I am not mistaken, @Faithless, you had the most prestigious person in the world at the time with around half the positive prestige as the least prestigious person had negative prestige. One solution that could easily bypass all of this would be to add a temporary bonus to prestige to sort of allow the AI to stay out of the red long enough to swim later on without the bonus. The only issue is this would need to be applied to every character (or at least those with peace prestige loss). The other solution (and my personal favorite) is to reduce the malus. When you think about it, the function of peace prestige loss is not to exterminate war-like religions (as is its function in its current state) but to discourage those people from staying at peace for too long. Their people will become restless and they will not be respected. At the current rate, the only way for most of the lords of these religions to even keep out of the red is to set an ambition to have a child and get very lucky very quickly. If the malus were adjusted to better communicate the notion that rulers will become unrespected if they are not at war for some time, this would likely fix the issue. On a similar note, the penalty for having fewer than three wives and being Muslim is the same; it might be a kind of prestige thing in the sense that you aren't as wealthy (or decadent) as a caliph, but -2 authority per month? Not to mention that having fewer wives hardly portrays your authority (prestige is a different matter, remember).

Edit: Especially since the mod offers you plenty of opportunities if you want to play a conquering game, for which you just have to play a realm with access to expansion CB or the really bad-ass total war CB... You can find them in the matrix, here is a quick reminder of religions with access to total war CB:
- Ofridrtivaric
- Ragnaroker
- Tengri-Ahrimanic
- Angra Mainyui
- Ahrimanic

So while the above religions can declare war and conquer a lot... I do not want to see the indohellenic kingdoms who survived in their fragmented state for more than a millenia, conquer each other immediately at game start... if you play such a realm, you want the pace of wars to be slower...
I found in my later stages of playing as the Huns that the Total War CB was significantly harder to use, and even became unusable in some instances. Kind of took the fun out of it 

This one quote below is particularly interesting in hinting at 2 things we could do:
- some specific "natural enemy" CB, for example between ahrimanic and zoroastrian;
- maybe more use of the defensive bonus mechanic...:
riknap, check this in particular.


So yes, authority loss for the various penalties can be made less punishing. Further, maybe some mechanisms to "purchase" authority when in need can be considered, as part of LIBERT3 module?
- Maybe by modding existing decisions (banquet etc.) and adding some. 
- CK1 gave you a one-time boost in piety when you built a church, why not something similar if feasible (?). 
- what would a leader do to increase authority? Hold court to give justice to its constituents, visit bannermen to help them with petty issues, etc. Maybe you can decide to "actively rule" for a while -> fertility and health penalty, malus to all counsellors's relevant stats as they cannot perform their duty as normal anymore, but monthly authority gain double the not at war penalty. So a tribal leader could do that when at peace. OK it is a big thing to mod all this, so this is just food for thought...
