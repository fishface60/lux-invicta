[COLOR="#FFD700"][b]Compatible:[/b][/color] Alpha-v005 compatible with minor issues (see known issues)

[COLOR="#FFD700"][b]Changelogs:[/b][/color] [spoiler]
alpha-006 (aka the Authority of Gold patch)
> reimplemented the separate GUI line for traits (courtesy of Korbah and Elder Kings )
> removed the Glorious Invasion CB pending corrections
> corrected a republic trade event issue with bracketing
> corrected temple holdings being scoped elsewhere
> rebalanced castle/temple/palace holdings a bit: added + 15 LI + 10 AR to simulate light skirmishers present in any army (because, tactics aside, an all-knight army is just inherently unrealistic )
> increased number of castle buildings giving retinue size
> added back Mercenary Contracts, Foreign Auxiliary, and Militia chains to castles
> added in the rest of the government-tree buildings for castle holdings (not that many of these rely on economy/military/education-tree buildings that aren't in yet to advance anyway)
> updated the technology list of building transitions for Feudal Enlightenment
> tentatively integrated the tactics component of Better Armies (at least until I get my own ABCDE project off the ground )
> implemented project balance factions (unedited yet)
> implemented project balance demesne laws (ie. non-crown laws) (NOTE: maay not be accessible to current save-games)
> tweaked the existing Lux Invicta crown laws (pending comprehensive PB crown law integration ) [spoiler]
>> Tweaked Economic Policies to have a -15% vassal and global tax at minimum to +15% at maximum
>> Tweaked Military Policies to have -15% minimum vassal levies at minimum to +15% at maximum, with +5% land organisation per level after 0
>> modified changing requirements: can now enact laws with ambitious/diligent/scholar/just/hardworking/restless/gregarious/magnetic/practical/authoritative/noblespirit/naturalleader/rebellious, but NOT with slothful/content/gullible/oldfashioned/cautious/callous/submissive/weakwilled
>> reduced requirements to 500 authority and 100 gold instead of 800 authority and 200 gold
>> tentatively retained the "control policy" as it is to preserve save-game compatibility (?) [will reuse this for a more comprehensive integration of PB laws ]
[/spoiler]
> LIBERT3 v12 balancing:[spoiler]
>> tentatively disabled the possibility to use the Glorious Invasion without naturalleader/ambitious
>> made vassal mercenaries slightly more expensive to hire and cheaper to field by 25%
>> made contractual mercenaries slightly more cheaper to hire and expensive to field by 25%
>> incresed geographic distance mercenaries can be hired from 450 to 500
>> increased de jure assimilation for (adjacent to dejure) de facto duchies to 150 years
>> reduced de jure assimilation for kingdom to empire titles to 50 years
>> reduced patrician tax to liege to 33.3%
>> Nerfed effect of realm stewardship and realm intrigue on tax to 0.2% per realm attribute level (previously 0.5% and 0.4%). Intrigue now increases vassal tax, while stewardship increases global tax.
>> Increased "break even" realm stats (to avoid penalties) to 25 again
>> Added a minor +0.3 monthly authority and +0.15 monthly character piety for low decadence muslims (<10) in addition to prior effects
>> Gave a -0.25 and -0.5 monthly authority malus for medium (50~75) and high (75+)decadence muslims respectively in addition to prior effects
>> reduced tech gain from attributes back to a third of vanilla (0.03)
>> increased spread of tech via trade
>> increased maximum effect of demesne bonuses (to tech spread) to 100%
>> reduced assassination costs to 50/tier as well as authority cost to 50 to... slightly encourage it in-game, as is period-appropriate
>> modified Diplomatic Disaster to give -15% revolt risk instead of -20% but have -30 general opinion and -0.5 monthly authority
>> reduced patrician prerogative authority to 1.5 monthly but boosted minimum vassal levy to 30%
>> gave patricians a modified version of feudal stat-bonuses that trigger with at least 20 points:[spoiler]
> Arbiter of the People get 1.5 monthly authority, 0.5 monthly piety, 30 opinion
> Champion of the Masses get 40% minimum levy, 10% max levy, +0.3 land morale and reorganization, +20% levy size, and +1 monthly authority
> Harvester of the Community get 15% vassal tax modifiers, 25% global tax modifier, -25% building cost modifier, and 1.5 monthly authority
> Enforcer of the Public gets 0.25 assassinate chance, -10% global revolt risk, 1.5 monthly authority, +1 health/fertility
> Illuminati of the Society gets techpoints, +2 monthly authority, +0.5 monthly piety, +10 general opinion [/spoiler]
>> Rebalanced Realm Administration Mechanics:[spoiler]
> Reduced size of max holdings for Centralized Administration to 20 holdings, and Localized Administration to 40.
> Reduced gap between Administration tiers to 20-holding gaps. 
> Expanded Administration now ranges from 40~200 holdings.
> Imperial Administration now ranges from 200~500 holdings (max -60% reduction all throughout )
> Price of Power now starts at 500 holdings, and gives -75% flat reduction all throughout
> Prestigious Empire (for empire-title realms) now at 250~500 holdings, with a stronger version (50% bonus) at 500~750 holdings
[/spoiler]
[/spoiler]
[u]KNOWN ISSUES[/u]:
> A lot of buildings still not in (mainly because I didn't add that many buildings in really ), thus "nobuilding" requirements in many buildings
> the summer Fair CTD event is still in there
> icons for some tactics are not showing up correctly
> Demesne laws are not changeable for mid-game updates
> Visby is still ... oddly positioned with this update (solved in the internal build, but left untouched for compatibility)
> The Norse Mod laws haven't been properly integrated with the new demesne laws yet.
[/spoiler]

Hypothetically save-compatible (ie it would... "work"), this update should help make future campaigns more fun to play while we work on another more comprehensive alpha update.

[u]NOTE: If you want to keep your laws working mid-save, then simply delete the decisions/demesne_laws.txt file before copy-pasting it.[/u]

I didn't include any updates done on the main build, since I'll need time to properly sort them out and their dependencies, and I really don't have time for that yet, so no VIET updates here or SELIN updates as this is mostly a LIBERT3 update.

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][b]Changelogs:[/b][/color]
[spoiler]
v8d12+01
- Integrated cybrxkhan's Saxongfx for Central Germanic (germangfx) culture
- Integrated SCARRED by siroland  portrait graphics for some of the health/physical/illnesses traits)
- Integrated clothes from Crackthoothgrin's Steppe Faces
- New religious clothings (made from combined material from vanilla, BLC and Steppe Faces). There's plenty to use now but I plan to expand on this.
- Fixed some minor alignment issues here and there.
- No more rulers here and there wearing bishop cloth. I'm done with that stupid fashion trend.

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][b]NOTE:[/b][/color] All face DLC's required to avoid black boxes

[url="http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?602941"]Better Looking Characters[/url] was made by Shaytana and previously integrated by default in Lux Invicta. As this made facial DLC's mandatory however, it was decided to make it an optional download instead.
Primary maintenance work is currently handled by DarkReborn and futuregary, so contact them for information and suggestions regarding this sub-mod.

all right. there goes my weekend.
I'll probably be slightly less productive the following week or so as I'll focus my free time on my academic requirements (the most tedious of which involve Scilab programming... :( ), but I'll try to resume work on buildings once I'm mostly in the clear.

Of course, do keep reporting any balance-related comments and stuff you notice, so that I could always keep on balancing and fine-tuning LI mechanics :D
