
Restrictions for Battlefield duels should be put in duel_battle_events.txt event 5556000 and 5556001 --anything in the "duel" namespace is the Duel Engine itself and should be kept as generic as possible as the same code is used by all duels.

Basically the chain is this:

Calling event: sets the flags on the combatants, then calls the duel engine with [B]hidden_tooltip = { e_rebels = { holder_scope = { character_event = { id = duel.1 } } } }[/B]
For battlefield duels this is event 5556002 (5556000 and 5556001 allow attacker and defender to fight or run).

Once the duel is over, it outputs to [B]duel_engine_events.txt[/B] where you should clear up the flags, and call the follow-up event. For example with battlefield duels, the output event for a kill is [B]duel_battle_events.txt[/B] event 5556100, and for spared opponent it is 5556101.
Since the DE tracks four different flags you can potentially have a different outcome for all of these:

-opponent killed
-opponent wounded
-opponent maimed
-opponent spared

Plus of course you can use any flags set by the calling or receiving events based on winner (FROM in output event) and loser (FROMFROM in output event).

(put this in the second post as it is generally useful, probably).
