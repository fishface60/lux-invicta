notes:

* this will essentially be the generic centralization law, king's peace and all, with the only difference being external inheritance disabled for all by default (because it isn't really LI appropriate). NOTE: "pagans" get special restrictions in editing their crown control laws
**economic policy is mostly the same really aside from modified values
***military policy will essentially overwrite the Crown Levies of PB
