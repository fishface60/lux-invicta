[QUOTE=The Zealot;15761919]I was going to say "absolutely", but then I'm not so sure if I know what you're talking about.
I can let you know that we started without the Sunset Invasion DLC ticked, and that we still deleted the mentioned avatar .gfx files, including the BASE_AGE = 16 change, but always producing the same CTD just instants after showing the Lux Invicta background picture.[/QUOTE]
Odd.
The only potential CTD triggers I could think of right now is
a) not fully uninstalling prior versions before installing the current alpha
b) not deleting all 8 .gfx files mentioned (or alternatively, possessing all relevant DLC's for that matter)
c) using an incompatible mod accidentally (do check if you didn't accidentally keep CK2+ on since it's a "sticky" tickbox).	


[QUOTE=Portal;15762078]So, of you're Alexandros-Ammonite, you're screwed because you can't raid and don't have access to the Mithraic Sacred War CB?

Edit: Oh, Sacred War is for all Martial Soul religions. Still, can we remove the trait requirements?[/QUOTE]
[QUOTE=SirKulinski;15762379]That will more than likely not happen. These are in here because the ruler has to be competent (traits/stats) enough to do it. Not everything should just available for all rulers to do.
Just like changing laws, building the high tier buildings / special buildings.[/QUOTE]

One redesign of the Sacred War CB I've been thinking of is to make it similar to our redesign of the Conversion CB.
Namely, there will be three different "requirements" 
a) possessing the religious traits  =  small gold requirement, minor authority and piety[u]bonus[/u] (+50 or less)
b)lacking the religious traits but has authority stockpile = moderate authority [u]cost[/u] (100 or less) but minimal piety [u]bonus[/u] (+20 or less)
c) lacking religious traits AND authority = moderate to substanial gold requirement (100, 150, 200, or 250 gold requiremet depending on available piety)

This should make the Sacred War mostly available anytime. The rewards will be the same (+250 authority, +100 piety for victory; +100 authority +50 piety for white peace; -100 authority +10 piety -25% annual income gold).
