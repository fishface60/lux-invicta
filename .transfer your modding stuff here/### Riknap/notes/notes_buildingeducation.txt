here are some of the notes I've been making regarding how buildings will add tech

added some education points for some castle buildings for now: [the city/church holdings will mirror be "based" on these]
> scribes give economy techpoints (+0.15/full chain)
> libraries give culture (+0.15) and some economy techpoints (+0.05)
> roads give some tech spread

the planned differentiation between holdings with regards to tech additions are:
> castle education buildings cost quite the amount of tax to upkeep
> city education buildings give a weaker amount of techpoints but no tax upkeep
> church education buildings have no tax upkeep but give the same amount as castle buildings, but cost slightly more

also for generalized principles on how tech is earned
> for cities are the university building chains, which cost some tax upkeep but give a decent amount of techpoints (economy & culture ) and techspread
> military techpoints will come primarily from the different military-tree (whether early-game like defence initiatives or late-game like local nobilities) and government-tree buildings of castles holdings, with a lot also from temple holdings and a handful from city holdings (mostly the city guard related chains)
> many temple holding buildings will have small amounts of tech spread to them



feel free to comment on them so that I can understand how to best calibrate them for realism/plausibility and gameplay/enjoyability
