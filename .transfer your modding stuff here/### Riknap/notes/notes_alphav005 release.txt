And once again, with the advent of the new moon comes the dawn of the Invincible Light.

Yet another alpha, this version nonetheless makes great strides in terms of rebalancing a lot of core mechanics to make playing this more dynamic yet remaining challenging as intended.

Among the features include significant rebalance, returning of some buildings back to play, an abundance of new localisations, some updates to SELIN (note that the bulk of the significant overhaul will be moved to the next alpha, both so that a stable pre-overhaul version is available as well as to have more work on it done rather than trickle updates ), as well as removing the dependency on DLC's (BLC was temporarily removed - it will be returned once the primary BLC module and consequently the integrated BLC module is worked on and updated ).

(minor notes: the Conversion War, among a couple of others, was tentatively removed pending corrections to the CB code)

[COLOR="#FFD700"]Changelog:[/b][/color][/size]  alpha-005 (aka the Restoration Update)
[spoiler]
> Increased the level of incoporated castle buildings by a couple of chains (enough for history settings to be reincorporated properly)
> Added early-tier city and temple buildings 
> Added regional levies/traditions for cities and churches, and removed their basic static modifier units.
> Added the Martial/Mercantile/Missionary Traditions buildings back in (and thus the relevant event mechanics)
> Added and rebalanced the Serene Merchant Republic building - it now in total gives: Levy Size +25%, Tax +15, Galleys +10, Garrison Size +100%, Tech Spread +1%

> Updated SELIN mechanics as collectively discussed in the thread, with the exception of the heresy mechanics as agreed upon
> Removed .gfx files from unit scaledown [80] that got accidentally reincorporated and causing CTD's

[/spoiler]
> LIBERT3 v12 balancing[spoiler]
>> pagan peace penalty -1 authority a month after 3 years now
>> prepared invasions (for those with them) now no longer requires holdings in target kingdom. also only 500 authority now required.

>> reduced Muslim wife authority reduction to 0.15/month/wife
>> removed negative monthly piety from Unrespected Rulers modifier while increased the monthly piety for Well Respected Rulers by 100%
>> reduced monthly authority loss for rulers with low character attributes to -0.15 from -0.25 (except for low diplomacy stat, which is now -0.3 from -0.45).
>> increased monthly authority for high stat modifiers (both the middle-tier "Rennowned" and higher tier "Legendary" ones) universally by +1 authority/month. Increased the monthly authority/piety of the Kwisatz Haderach modifier by +2 /month.
>> Added a +0.5/+1 monthly authority per month for defending against a minor/major war.
>> Increased tech points per attribute from 0.04 to 0.05
>> Adjusted ideal year levels. Tech level zero "starts" at 1060, and 80 years passes between each tech level (thus "end game" by 1700)
>> Ahead penalty is now only 25% (previously 30%)
>> Modified disease parameters: a minimum of 20 income is needed for a town to be vulnerable to outbreaks, while an income of 50 guarantees the chance for an outbreak (with a 25% chance).

>> Reduced lootable gold regeneration to 2% from 2.5% per month
>> Tripled monthly authority when defending from wars (now +3 per month for defending against major invasions and +1.5 for minor wars).
>> Boosted Patrician Prerogative authority to 2.5/month to both compensate from lack of the feudal character modifiers and reflect their republican legitimacy.
>> Lowered threshold for "Renowned Diplomat/Commander/Investor/Puppetmaster/Scholar" to 15. They now trigger in the 15~29 range (30+ is still reserved for the "legendary" modifiers).
>> Made the Centralized and Localized Administration modifiers (for small realms) also give authority (+2 and +1.5 respectively), for a jumpstart boost.
>> Gave the Expanded Administration a decreasing amount of authority (+1 max)
>> increased bonus of trade post connected to capital to 50%
>> doubled Assist Arrest revolt risk reduction for Marshals and a proportional tax reduction
>> added revolt risk reduction to the Organize Spies action of Spymasters in exchange for reduced assassination chance
>> modified the Chancellor's Revolt Risk job to a Pacify Province job, which reduces revolt risk more than Assist Arrest and Organize Spies, but reduces income and build speed
>> Made the spymaster's "steal technology" job to a "Subterfuge" job option, and transferred the Vicious Rumors (spy) and Sow Dissent events (chancellor) here.
>> Increased income and authority/piety from Council jobs ten-fold (and added 0.15 monthly authority for spymaster )

> Rebalanced the way buildings give technology:
[spoiler]
> scribes give economy techpoints (+0.15/full chain)
> libraries give culture (+0.15) and some economy techpoints (+0.05)
> roads give some tech spread
the planned differentation between holdings with regards to tech buildings are:
> castle education buildings cost quite the amount of tax to upkeep
> city education buildings give a weaker amount of techpoints but no tax upkeep
> church education buildings have no tax upkeep but give the same amount as castle buildings, but cost slightly more

the planned differentiation with regards to tech sourcing:
> available only for cities are the university building chains, which cost tax upkeep but give a decent amount of techpoints (economy & culture )
> military techpoints will come primarily from the different military and government tree buildings of castles holdings, with some from temple holdings and a handful from city holdings
> many temple holding buildings will have small amounts of tech spread to them

[u]KNOWN ISSUES:[/u]
> Many localisations regarding CB's and Council Jobs (or at least events) are slightly... off. 
> the Glorious Invasion CB shows up despite you not meeting prequisites (the gui code probably doesn't detect the conditions correctly)
> TENTATIVELY disabled the Conversion War and the Religious Subjugation CB until I could fix what's making them... odd next time
> holdings still aren't at full "capacity" yet as well (though currently present ones have increased a fair amount)
> the vanilla siege and duel events are still not yet in (couldn't find them yet)
> somehow the Marshal's research military tech is missing (no idea why, and can't fix it right now T_T )
[/spoiler]


[hr][/hr]
quick commentary on the patch:



the Conversion War, among a couple of others, was tentatively removed pending corrections to the CB code

if you checked the patch notes, you'll notice we also integrated a couple of mods (with permission, naturally). 
For one, MZ events/mechanics only of course work for Zoroastrians, so more reason to play as them (as if TOG didn't give you enough already) - this is especially important since Ehanshar is one of the two original important realms in this mod (the other being Imperium Romanum).
The Climate mod is another. It should make gameplay a lot more seasonal and immersive in my opinion, so be sure to take it into consideration when you plan out your campaigns.

and yeah, we tentatively disabled BLC so that we could work on it (the brunt of the work was futuregary's, so thank him for that [though if there are any problems, know of course that I'm responsible for the call anyway, so let me know] )

you might have also noticed some ... cinematography in the start. tell me if it's annoying or something, so that I could know how to improve it (though know of course it can only go from point A to point B in a straight line anyway, so no fancy curved paths or something :3 ).


other comments:

I've updated the [url="http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?612823-MOD-Lux-Invicta&p=15668420&viewfull=1#post15668420"][Calibration Coordinates][/url] to include relevant information that should help the player make informed decisions.
I was planning some time ago to also make a list of triggerable modifiers as well as Lux Invicta-important decisions, but I kept forgetting and right now I don't have much time to do so, so I'll just add them in sometime sooner or later. Incidentally, I've also slightly reorganized and updated the OP and the LIBERT3 portal (by a bit) to reflect some of the recent changes, as well as trimmed down the FAQ (as if people read it anyway :p )

And yeah, it's still a few hours before midnight, so take THAT!
