I to remove with extreme prejudice:

- Try to convince the Tings, the freemen, that you should rule... and fight off disloyal vassals if you do not! This is the most <CISPA'd> annoying thing ever. As if ruling as a Nord isn't hard enough in this game, god forbid you get the random chance the <CISPA'd> Tings don't like you and your entire empire hates you. <CISPA'd> this.
- Peasant revolts from Norse provinces if you centralize. Or have high taxes. Or aren't Norse. Or just 'cause. Added to TOG. Also, that last line describes why I <CISPA'd> this mod.
- Face rebellions and invasions if you aren't prestigious enough, or are too weak, or have gone raiding for too long. So you can't be at war for too long, but you can't be at peace for too long or you'll lose enough authority to get the rebellions and invasions as if you were at war for too long.
- Get declared a Niding, and avoid getting killed until you can convince the Tings that you are not worth less than a cockroach! Who the <CISPA'd> are these Tings, we'll see who's a cockroach when they've been <CISPA'd> with a <CISPA'd> bat.

II to keep with modifications

- Laws are for weaklings! Improve taxation and levy size by increasing prestige (and piety in the case of temples)! Largely unnecessary, but a little fun. #the dynamic law changing with respect to authority is quite nice actually and a different pace from other faiths. let's keep them.
- Seid! Use the Court Volva to see portents, cure the sick... and scare the peasants # we can merge this with the current volva system of TOG
- Seid! Become a Seidmann or Volva, and use the secret knowledge of herbs and divination for your own gain. They listed seid twice. Neither is particularly important to Lux anyway. # ditto above
- Go off the deep end (lunatic or possessed), convince yourself you are a child of a God... then convince others! This event has been the bane of my Alexanders since I first played. Let's <CISPA'd> it. #you were confusing Shaytana's one-off event and this rather fun event-chain were you become Son of Odin/Thor/Loki/POPERAGNAROKTHEFIREBENDER
- Other random events, such as being challenged to a duel by a strong subject. Already in Lux. #these are actually quite interesting flavour events (in fact we can expand their coverage to other religions, but let's consult the others first), so let's keep them in one form or another.
- Raid enemies for glory and gold. Added to TOG. # somehow make these viking events into general raiding events.
