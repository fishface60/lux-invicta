- religion-based tactics, I think, would really be a cherry on the cake, with the cake itself being culture-based tactics. Still... soul-based tactics could be fun. Let's say 1 "special" tactic /soul activated in case of high piety of the commander (if this can be tested during a battle, not sure). Messianic: "Holy Martyrdom of the Righteous" with horrendous modifier to infantry with sever impact for both sides (+ attack / - defense / +morale) ; Martial: "Holy Martial Chants" with almost no casualty but strong morale attack (think Roman descriptions of the frightening Celtic war drums) ; Scholarly: "Deployment of a War Machine" with huge bonus for heavy infantry (i.e. the professional soldiers manning it) or archers (if in skirmish phase); Statist: well I am not inspired; Clerical: "Holy Charge": OK a more or less standard charge with high morale defense; Traditional: "Rally around a holy symbol": strong defensive tactic; Populist: "People's awakening": strong bonii for light infantry only.
