So I was thinking of codifying the refined design principles in polishing the building system. 
The following are the different ways I'll be calibrating buildings of the same type to make them different from each other. In short, these are the "holding calculus" I'll be basing balance polishing from.

Castles - specialize on retinue points
- martial emphasis on levy size
- many buildings reduce garrision size
- many non-education buildings give martial techpoints*
- education buildings are primarily administrative, with balanced techpoints and techspread
- education buildings have upkeep, but decent effects
- access to more advanced mid/late-game military tree buildings

Cities - specialize on economy
- martial emphasis on garrison size
- fewer buildings reduce army size, mostly of levies
- many non-education buildings give economy techpoints*, and give higher techspread**
- education buildings give emphasis on tech spread
- education buildings have no upkeep, but lesser effects.
- access to more advanced mid/late-game economy tree buildings

Churches - specialize on education
- martial emphasis on levy quality (land morale and bonuses)
- minimal reduction of sizes and effects, in exchange for higher construction costs
- many non-education buildings give culture techpoints*
- educuation buildings give emphasis on techpoints (balanced culture/economy tech points )
- education buildings have no upkeep, decent effects, but slightly more expensive
- access to advanced mid/late-game university tree and Academy-type buildings

* I was planning on eventually making advanced education-type buildings for all of them that each give specialized education. For example, an Armory Guild or something not only gives increased defence for all unit types, but also extra techpoints for martial. Similarly, the same goes for some type of "Religious Schools" and what not for temples and similar stufff like a Banker's Guild for Cities. Again, these are hypothetical examples :p
**road-type, port-type, and market-type buildings all give techspread for all holdings

@DarkReborn
I was planning on making temple/city-holding academy-type buildings (accessible relatively early on [tech 1 or 2?] that serve as triggers for your planned Academy events. Would that be a bad idea?
