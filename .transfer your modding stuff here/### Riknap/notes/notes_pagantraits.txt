well that would be fun... Let us see:
(I try 1. to mirror the existing system and 2. to avoid creating traits)

Virtue / "Sin" (well, not technically a sin, but negative trait)
Lustful / Chaste (inverted)
Gluttonous / Temperate (inverted)
Generous / Greedy (slight change of the virtue, non existing trait ATM: a beefed-up version of charitable, like the character constantly organizes large feasts where he treats his court and vassals...)
Diligent / slothful (unchanged)
Gregarious / Shy (existing traits, replace the Kind / Envious opposition)
Strong / Weak (existing traits, replace the Patient / Wroth opposition)
Proud / Humble (inverted)

So my ideal Pagan ruler would be: Strong, Proud, Diligent, Generous, Gregarious, Lustful and Gluttonous. Well, sounds like a good boss to follow, what do you say? More inspiring than most bosses I had anyway

(I can also make a sort of equivalent of the "true Glchristian knight" thingy for the rulers who do have all those traits. I don't know, "Paragon of the Gods" or something?)


Hey riknap, this has been my shower time topic of thought for the last few days... 

So I have a suggestion, that I even wanted to implement but I find devoting all my time to spiritual research... so here it is:
Starting from 4 of these traits, Pagan rulers get a triggered modifier with increasingly powerful bonii.

- 4 traits (a lot of combinations to code with IF so maybe should be scraped): Promising leadership - This ruler may develop what it takes to raise higher.
Symbolic bonus, for example +0.05 morale / +0.05 levy size 

- 5 traits: Inspiring Leadership - This ruler is known for his capacity to inspire his followers. A promising leader!
+0.2 morale +0.1 levy size +1 Authority /month

- 6 traits: Exceptional Leadership - This ruler has a natural gift for leadership and to impose authority, towards his followers and beyond. An exceptional ruler! 
+0.5 morale +0.3 levy size +5 Authority /month +5 General Opinion

- 7 traits: Blessed by the Gods - This ruler's leadership is only rivaled by the Gods' themselves. He shall rule over the World!
+0.5 morale +0.3 levy size +10 Authority /month +15 General Opinion

This way you may end up with the "Genghis Khan / Attila" syndroma resulting in a snowball effect for exceptional Pagan rulers (especially because of the authority bonus resulting, eventually, in advancing your tribal authority pagan laws).

Then to balance it out you create mirror modifiers for the "Sins" so that nobody will want to follow a meek, chaste, weak, slothful etc. tribal leader.
