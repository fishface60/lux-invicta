libert.300.name;The Invincible Light Beckons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.300.desc;The Litany of the Liberating Light, the module of LIBERT3, enkindles the Invincible Light. The Balance of old world has been undone, and reforged from the dust to the image of the visions of the Creator, whose return we await. This Codex would serve to orient the Filial Force who reads this to the new realities of the Invincible Light. \nAs consequence of the resunder, many new truths are in effect, some apparent in a glimmer, some with time and wisdom. The new realities of the Invincible Light are myriad, as the module of LIBERT3's scope has expanded.  He who wishes to unite the Realm of Man must master these truths to make use of them in the journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.300.a;The Invincible Light is Eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.301.name;Stay Awhile and Listen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.301.desc;Legitimacy is cultivated from authority, and is necessary to rule. The most skilled of rulers are granted favours by the gods, and the most legendary of rulers even more so, while the unworthy are scorned by gods and men alike. Succession is a right that demands an equivalent responsibility as the kneeled itch to stand alone, and locals do not assimilate within a mere century as with the Old Balance. \nThe dance of steel and shouts becomes ever more refined as do the actors that partake become more discerning. Vast tracts of land require the appropriate administration to deal with it, and can provide only so much. The rise to power of trader families will challenge the supremacy of their warrior-lieges. There is much to be learned, so stay awhile and listen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.301.a;Free Choice is an illusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.311.name;Authority and Action;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.311.desc;Foremost amongs the new realities is the truth of "Authority", the legitimacy of your ruler, earned through prestige and combat and spent in actions necessary to rule the realm. Preserving your Authority is significant as the ruled only obey those who prove themselves worth obeying, and many acts of rulership demand a price in Authority. \nThose whose authority plummet suffer the disrepect of the ruled, while those with an abundance of authority are respected and obeyed. The act of balancing authority while using it is more intricate than it has ever been in the Old Balance, and may you succeed where others fail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.311.a;Then I shall prove my worthiness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.312.name;Rulership and Renown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.312.desc;Your worthiness is decided not just by your actions, but your subjects as well. The skill of both the ruler and the state is crucial. If the State Attribute is below 20, then the realm suffers. In the same vein, if the ruler's attribute is below 5, then even the best councillors can do nothing to counter both the scorn of the ruled and the disaster the ruler's policies will bring. \nOn the other hand, renowned rulers with attributes above 20 command their subjects' respect and fervor, and even more so for the legendary few whose attributes surpass 30. And then there is THE Legend, the one who can achieve 30 in all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.312.a;Then I shall forge my own legend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.313.name;Succession and Sedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.313.desc;Be wary, however. Very few subjects desire to stay as such, and they bend their knee not to the state, but to the suzerain. A legendary suzerain cannot guarantee his realm will not fracture if the successor is barely a shadow. \nEven then, the very act of succession of the ruler is guaranteed to trigger the ambitions of the ruled, and even worthy successors will find themselves needing to reassert their suzerainty. Furthermore, right to rule is cherished, and as such they will resist assimilation and will always consider themselves their own rulers. \nThe world of the Invincible Light only respect might after all, and the collapse of the empires of the Romans is good proof of such.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.313.a;Then I shall prove my right with might!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.314.name;Warfare and Weaponry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.314.desc;If you wish to do so, then you must be warned that the Art of War has evolved since the Old Balance. Peace is much valued by many except a few, and as such wars always carry a consequent price, be it in legitimacy or to the economy. Different reasons for war carry different weights. Some wars may be viewed as righteous and inspire your people to glory, yet all will contribute more to the realm in its defense. \nAlso instrumental to refinement of the dance of combat are the forms taken. Terrain is twice as important than before, and the roles of soldiers have evolved since the Old Balance, among many other Truths. Perhaps just as important to the dance of war are the men who partake in them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.314.a;Then I will master these masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.315.name;Might and Manpower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.315.desc; At the Dawn of the New Start, men who fight to defend their lands are outcount men who fight beyond for plunder and glory. With time, the reverse becomes true for the men of nobles, while the folk of cities and churches stay true. What is consistent though is that they are far less in number than the Old Balance. \nMen who fight for Coin and Chantry are also recast. Those who call themselves free companies charge far more upfront than those who are bound to service of a liege, yet at the same time cost far less to keep in field than those with a liege as they can provide for their own. \nThe Retainers of Old have faded to oblivion, and currently only the elite of your culture can be called as such. It is possible to bring their return via the Unbound module, found in the Portal of the Chuunibyou's wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.315.a;Then we need just expand the realm to empower the host!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.316.name;Logistics and Land-Ruling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.316.desc;That may not be as simple done as said. Another Truth to consider is that the management of the resources of the realm is not an easy task, and the price of greatness is the difficulty in tapping the potential. \nAs the vastness of the lands of the realm increases, so too is the burden in enforcing dominion. More feudatories and soldiers mean more kneelers unnoticed and men unfielded, as the Arms of the State can only reach so far. You would do well the take heed of this price you pay in unifying the Realm of Man. Even then, not all vassals are equal. Some do not concern themselves with men, and would rather provide scuttage in coin instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.316.a;What of these gold-farmers then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.317.name;Money and Merchants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.317.desc;These are the trader dynasties whose rise to power has been only recent. Calling themselves republics, their home cities are more advanced than most, and they have traditions that further their advantages. \nLike any other rulers however, the strength of their State Attributes determines how fortunate they are in trade and fortune. Their capability to expand their trade posts is also affected by their capacity to develop their dynastic properties. But perhaps comfortingly, their successors to their republics are chosen based also on authority, so even the most wealthy scions will be fall if they are unrespected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.317.a;A chilly tale, my brother.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.318.name;Interface of the Filial Force;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.318.desc;In other news, an entity that styles itself "Arumba" has granted the module of LIBERT3, the Litanty of the Liberating Light, what it calls "hotkeys": \n the "z" key raises the levies directly controlled \nthe minor "x" key dismisses the currently selected host, while the major "x" key dismisses all selected hosts \nthe "c" key raises the water vessels in the selected holding \nthe "v" key orders the selected host to board the armada at port \nthe "b" key joins the selected hosts or armadas in the same province together \nthe "n" key brings up the trade ports while the "m" key brings up the regular holding informations \n the "\" key brings back the previously chosen window;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.318.a;Relatable words well spoken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.399.name;Lux Invicta Aeterna!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libert.399.desc;With such knowledge shown, the secrets of the Litanty of the Liberating Light are made known. Countless more Truths await, as the Invincible Light will continue to evolve under disciples awaiting the World Builder's return. Tales of new stories of Friends and Foes, of chronicles from Vanilla Immersion and Events and Traits, and the revolution in tactics of Advanced Battles and Combat Depth Essentials. But those are stories for another time, in another future, in another worldline. \nFor now, there is your tale to tell, your divergence number to record. The Tale of the Filial Force and the Unification of the Realm of Man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
