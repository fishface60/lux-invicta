Almaqah is also considered the patron deity of the Saba Kingdom, and it's rulers are said to descend from him.

antinomian_DESC;Antinomianism is a Christian Heretical sect of Populist soul, with a strong Barbarian ascendant. It emerged in the 1st Century as a result of theological criticisms over the strict morale rules contained in the Old Covenant. According to some, moral law was of no use or obligation under the gospel dispensation of grace because faith alone was necessary to salvation. Under this theological guidance, some early Christian communities in Jerusalem are said to have practiced anarchist communism, sharing money, labor and women equally and fairly among the members, refusing any set of rules that they considered arbitrary. These early experiments, remembered by marginalized priests exiled to the fringes of Christianity, spurred a renewal among superficially-Christianized Goths when imperial authority weakened. In the ensuing chaos, new ambitious leaders looking for a mobilizing ideology met the radical preachers of the Antinomian revolution. The new Antinomian rulers claimed that Jesus' love, which is limitless, would wash away the sinful laws and hierarchies set up by the former Roman elite. Antinomianism is now a political and economic program as much as a religion, whereby believers combine Gothic tribal rituals with a new emphasis on moral nihilism, sexual freedom, and absolute collectivism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apollinarist_DESC;Apollinarism is a Local Christian creed of Clerical soul. Apollinarists follow the teachings of Apollinaris of Laodicea, a bishop in Syria during the 4th Century.

This goes against the traditional view that Jesus had both a human body and mind, as culminated by his presence as the Son of God made flesh. Apollinarism was declared to be a heresy in 381 CE  by the First Council of Constantinople. Since Christ was officially depicted as fully human and fully God, followers of Apollinarianism were accused of attempting to create a tertium quid ("third thing"), neither God nor man. Apollinarius was a prolific writer and a charismatic missinary, and some clerics still follow his teachings, differenciating themselves from the mainstream Christian theology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arian_DESC;A Christian church founded by the presbyter Arius, emphasizing on the belief that Christ did not always exist, but as created by God, and is therefore separate from him.

The Audians complained that the church had "abandoned the fathers' Paschal rite in Constantine's time from deference to the emperor, and changed the day to suit the emperor." Audianist communities were later the target of sporadic persecutions, until Imperial authorities proposed to re-locate them North of the Black Sea where they would enjoy tolerance of their cult and act as a vanguard of the Imperial civilization. Since then, Audianists cling to their unique tradition, composed of outdated Christian rituals and nostalgia for the Syrian homeland they left centuries ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Bogomils derive their name from their founder, the priest Bogomil (Theophilus) and the teachings of the Paulicans, a group of Manichaeans that settled in Thrace in the late 8th Century. Because grace could not bind itself to matter, Bogomils believe that Christ had only the semblance of a human body, and they reject the Eucharist and other sacraments, as well as relics and the use of material items in worship.

The Cathars are a direct challenge to the Catholic Church, renouncing Catholic practices and dismissing it outright as the Church of Satan. Rather than traditional sacraments, Catharism has only one sacrament: the Consolamentum, in which a brief ceremony is performed to remove all sin from the believer, or credentus, thus making them a perfectus. This sacrament must only be performed once, but perfecti must maintain a strong obligation of purity (and thus, many Cathars perform the Consolamentum on their death-bed). Purity in this life is attained through asceticism and strict moral rules. Sexual actions, even when sanctified by marriage, are abhorred on the grounds that the material world - including the flesh - is intrinsically evil, and thus Cathars largely reject the concept of marriage.

fraticelli_DESC;Fraticelli is a Local Christian sect of Populist soul. Named the "Little Brothers", this sect was formed in response to corruption in the Catholic Church.

One of the key features of the Graeco-Roman pantheon is the gods' human-like nature,something that is not found in many other major religions such as Christianity, Islam, and others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gurzil_DESC;A warrior cult following Gurzil, the Amazigh god of war. Believers think that by worshipping Gurzil, he shall grant them victory in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haruri_DESC;A sect of Kharijites who differ in the belief that Ali had the right to the caliphate. This disagreement caused a schism and the two are in conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
horus_re_DESC;A henotheist egyptian faith worshipping mainly Re-Horakhty, "Ra, who is Horus of the Two Horizons", a merge of gods Horus and Ra, but also recognizing the other traditional Egyptian deities. Re-Horakhty is believed to rule in all parts of the created world: the sky, the earth, and the underworld.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hubal_DESC;A monotheistic cult worshipping Hubal, one of the main dieties of  the Arabian traditions. Hubal is a god of fertility, spring, abundance and agriculture. A typical altar to Hubal consists of putting an idol of his in a platform above a sacred well dedicated to him. Hubal's idol was the biggest and highest placed in the Kaaba at Meccah before the rise of Islam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hurufi_DESC; A heretical sect of Sufism that focuses around the letters of the Arabic alphabet and the number 7 as being holy. There is a strong emphasis on God's incarnation in everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ibadi_DESC;An isolationist sect of Islam with the belief that the attitude of a true believer is expressed in three ways: walayah (friendship with true believers, the Ibadi), bara'ah (dissociation with sinners and nonbelievers), and wuquf (reservation towards those whose status is unclear). Ibadis also believe that those who enter Hell remain there forever, that Muslims will not see God on the Day of Judgment, and that the Qur'an was created by God at a certain point in time. Ibadis also tend to reject caliphates, seeing them as corrupt beyond the first two rightful caliphs (Abu Bakr and'Umar ibn al-Kha??ab).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
iconoclast_DESC;Iconoclasm is a Heretical Christian religion of Clerical soul, with significant Islamic influences. During the 8th Century, Islam was becoming more and more popular in Arabia and more and more Eastern Christians were beginning to adopt the Muslim custom of aniconism, or absence of religious images or statues. Politically, this would ease relations with Islam, but also clerically, the Iconoclasts believed that any depictions of Jesus Christ would be flawed, either by depicting Him as a purely physical being, or confusing His two natures as both God and Man. In the 8th and early 9th Centuries, Iconoclasm grew to power significantly, and many religious artifacts, paintings, and statues were destroyed by the zealots. The Clergy hold a paticularly high place in society, as they are often tasked with deciding whether an item is a genuine holy artifact, or a blasphemous copy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
illuyanka_DESC;The cult of Illuyanka is a Heretical Luwian faith of Traditional soul. According to ancient Hittite legend, the sky god Tarhunt defeated the serpent dragon Illuyanka in battle and emerged as the supreme divine entity. As the Isaurian Emperor Leo III reformed the beliefs of the Chosen People of Light (the Luwians) to adapt the creed to his imperial agenda, some remote communities led by Leo III's own bastard daughter resisted the changes brought by the religious reforms. Their doctrinal opposition went so far at to defy orthodox Luwian dogma by claiming that the dragon Illuyanka actually vanquished Tarhunt and emerged as the supreme divine entity, guiding his followers through the ages of darkness to come. Illuyankan worshippers maintain isolated, secretive, and defiant communities, resistant towards the external world - Luwian or else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ilm_islam_DESC;A sect of Islam with strong emphasis on the study and scholastic lifestyle of Islam. A very intellectual sect, many adherents are well-educated and devote their lives to the study of the Qur'an.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ilmatar_DESC;The veneration of Ilmattar, the air spirit in the Kalevala (epic of Finland). Ilmattar is portrayed as androgynous, meaning they have both male and female elements. Ilmattar was impregnated by the sea and wind and gave birth to Vainamoinen, the main character in the Kalevala.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indoh_bud_DESC;A syncretic religion in which Buddhist beliefs and values are incorporated into the already syncretic Indo-Hellenic faith. As a result, this form of Hellenic-infused Buddhism is highly organized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indoh_hindu_DESC;A syncretic religion much like Indo-Hellenicism, but with the incorporation of Greek beliefs into Hinduism.  As a result, this form of Hellenic-infused Hinduism is highly organized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indoh_zor_DESC;The Pyromantic religion is actually composed by a combination of Hellenic mystery cults, fire worship based off a bastardised form of Zoroastrian rites and some hero-centric mythology. The biggest of these cults are the Pyraithoi. the "Priests of Fire", who arguably control the cult conglomerate under the auspices of the Ruler and maintain complicated rites of Pyromancy (divination through flames) at the High Temple of the Sacred Flame in Sistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indohelen_DESC;The Indo-Hellenic faith is a Local Graeco-Roman religion of Traditional soul. As the Greeks conquered Transoxiane and beyond, they brought their own belief system in these lands but also met new ones. When local princes did not favor one influence over the others, conquerors and commoners gradually integrated these new elements into the classical Hellenistic pantheon. Greeks were willing to acknowledge and in some cases even promote Indian deities they encountered in the northwestern subcontinent. While Buddhism, Hinduism, and Zoroastrianism have all had a sizeable influence on the development of the Indo-Hellenic religion, certain religions feature more prominently in various strains of this faith, and while some of these denominations may have cut ties and established a canon doctrine, the mainstream movement has maintained balance through the ever-changing times. The Hellenistic element remains dominant and aggregates all these elements: it not uncommon to see Zeus in presence of a both a Buddhist lion and the Hindu goddess Lakshmi in a single temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
irminsul_DESC;The worship of Irminsul is a Heretical German religion of Clerical soul. Irminsuls are great pillars made of holy trees which unite Earth and Sky, and through which the Divine can be approached, felt, and understood. Only the caste of priests is authorized to approach the Irminsul. During occult ceremonies held at irregular intervals, according to a calendar only known to those initiated, Wodanaz himself enters in communion with the Irminsul, communicates with the priests, and grants his protection to those who deserve it. It is said that Widukind was the only non-priest authorized to meet the greatest Irminsul just after defeating Charlemagne in 777 CE, when his spirit merged with the totems. The priests attending Irminsul enjoy a great authority over their communities. They accuse other Germanic beliefs which allow laymen to pray Wotan directly of being heretical, insulting to the Irminsul, and contrary to the essence of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
isis_DESC;A henotheistic Egpytian faith that centers it's cult around Isis, Mother Goddess and patroness of magic, but also recognizes and worships the other traditional Egyptian gods. Isis is also known as protector of the dead and goddess of children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jud_ark_DESC;A Judaic heresy that centers it's worship around using the Ark of the Covenant, or rather a replica of it, as a direct conduit to interpret the will of Yahweh. According to the Kebra Negast, the ethiopian "Book of the Glory of Kings", Menelik I brought the Ark to Ethiopia, but it was eventually lost. Adherents believe that when the true Ark is recovered, the connection with God will be restored and the Yehudim will return to their place as God's chosen people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jud_sabaoth_DESC;A heretical sect of Judaism following the emphasis on the existence of Yahweh as the Lord of Hosts, and that he shall grant his faithful victory against their enemies. It could be seen as a Jewish warrior cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jud_zion_DESC;Khawdash Siyun, or "Renewed Zion" is a heretic sect of Judaism that believes that Zion, the Land of Israel, is not in fixated piece of land, but in the Jewish people that carry it's will forward. Since the  people believe to be living in accordance with God, there is balance and happiness in the community not found in many other places. They seek to bring their message to all classes, from the lowest peasant to the highest king. According to tradition, it was founded by one of the lost tribes of Israel who settled between the White and Blue Nile;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
judaism_DESC;An Abrahamic religion off of which Christianity was based off of. While it has often been said that Judaism is essentially following the Old Testament in the Bible, it is much more complicated than that, and is considered an ethnoreligion (a religion very heavily intertwining with Judean culture).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jumala_DESC;The monotheistic worship of Jumala, the Estonian version of the sky god in Suomenusko. All other gods do not exist, and Jumala is the one true god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jupiter_DESC;The monotheistic worship of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, the Greatest and Most Powerful. There is no god but Jupiter in this religion, and to declare any other is blasphemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kharijite_DESC;Kharijitism is a Heretical Islamic madhab of Populist soul. It constituted itself in First Islamic War in the 7th Century CE by opposing both Sunnis and Shias, and by assassinating Ali (whom they admired) because of his conciliatory attitude towards his enemy Muawiyah. Since then they have been rejecting - often violently - all forms of political leadership, citing the verse "No rule but God's." They denounce most forms of codified Islamic jurisprudence as a betrayal to God's message contained wholly in the Holy Qur'an, and consider it legitimate to kill a caliph if his acts are sinful. While sharing with other branches of Shia Islam a fascination for Ali, Kharijites violently reject the worship of individual imams and pilgrimages to imamzadeh as superstitions dangerously close to pagan idolatry. The strength of this uncompromising fundamentalist message based on Ali's legacy exercices a strong appeal among the Shias who regard their current leaders and clergy as corrupted by their drive for wealth and power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lugh_DESC;Lughism is a sect of the Celtic faith that worships mainly Lugh mac Ethlenn, the hero-deity of the Celts and king of the Tuath Dé ("tribe of the gods"). His followers seek to follow his example as a warrior hero-deity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
luwian_DESC;The Luwian faith is a Mainstream Archaic religion of Statist soul. The religious system is a legacy of the ancient Hittite civilization, who created a complex pantheon reflecting the mosaic of peoples present in Asia Minor, under the strong influences of Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. Many Gods co-exist with multiple identities, as a result of  successive layers of syncretism, products of the Anatolian melting-pot. Although each God has a specific area of responsibility, they are collectively responsible to guide mankind on the path of morale and piety. The traditional Luwian faith was more recently reformed when the client-king of Isauria, the long-standing Hittite heartland, conquered Constantinople with support from the Eastern legions and imposed himself as Emperor Leo III in 716 CE. He introduced the cult of the Luwian sun goddess Arinniti as the new inperial state religion: he proclaimed Sol to be the consort of Arinniti, and the Emperor to be her consort in the flesh. The subsequent decades saw a short-lived global supremacy of the imperial Luwian faith. Leo III conquered Rome and sacrificed the Western Emperor to Arinniti, imposing the Luwian faith to the entire Roman empire through well-organized persecutions of the Christians. The Luwian supremacy culminated when his son and successor Leo Constantine conquered Jerusalem and desecrated the Christian holy sites. Since then, in spite of the numerous set backs, the faithful still trust their divine connection to Arinniti under the leadership of Leo III's heirs, semi-divinised as the flesh of Arinniti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maher_DESC;A warrior cult focusing on the worship of Maher, the Sabean/Ethiopian god of war. Followers believe that by worshipping Maher, he will grant them victory in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
malakbel_DESC;A sun-worshipping religion of Malakbel, the sun god of Palmyra. It is unlikely that this is a monotheistic religion, as Malakbel has a status as the messenger of Ba'al. However, Malakbel's veneration and position as a major god would likely be seen as blasphemous by traditional Elohimis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mand_ruha_DESC;The cult worship of Ruha d-Qudshai, the evil spirit allied with the Jewish Yahweh. The cult was founded by Kawus, the brother of the Sassanid emperor Khosrau I after hewas defeated by said brother in the Zoroastrian-Mazdakite civil war in 539 CE. Ruha d-Qudshai is regarded as the Holy Spirit in the Bible, Qur'an, and Torah, but in Mandaeism, she is regarded as an evil spirit responsible for the founding of Jerusalem and, with the help of her sons, the seven planets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandaean_DESC;Mandaean is a spiritually-influenced gnostic religion with a strongly-dualistic view. In Mandaeism, there are about nine features which are the fundamental tenets: 1) A supreme formless Entity, the expression of which in time and space is creation of spiritual, etheric, and material worlds and beings. Production of these is delegated by It to a creator or creators who originated in It. The cosmos is created by Archetypal Man, who produces it in similitude to his own shape. 2) Dualism is a strong feature of Mandaeism, with opposites in the cosmic universe such as Father and Mother, and Light and Darkness. 3) As a feature of this dualism, there are counter-types, a world of ideas. 4) The soul is portrayed as an exile, with home and origin being the supreme Entity to which the soul eventually returns. 5) Planets and stars influence fate and human beings, and are also places of detention after death. 6) A savior spirit or savior spirits which assist the soul on the journey through life and after it to 'worlds of light'. 7) A cult-language of symbol and metaphor. Ideas and qualities are personified. 8) 'Mysteries', i.e. sacraments to aid and purify the soul, to ensure rebirth into a spiritual body, and ascent from the world of matter. These are often adaptations of existing seasonal and traditional rites to which an esoteric interpretation is attached. In the case of the Na?oreans this interpretation is based upon the Creation story, especially on the Divine Man, Adam, as crowned and anointed King-priest. 9) Great secrecy is enjoined upon initiates; full explanation of the Creation Story, and the 'Mysteries' being reserved for those considered able to understand and preserve the gnosis. Marriage and procreation are a part of Mandaeism, and a strong emphasis on family life is placed. There is an abstention from strong drink and red meat, however. While Mandaeans reject Jesus of Nazareth, Abraham, and Moses, other characters from Abrahamic religions such as Adam, Abel, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Shem, Aram, and especially John the Baptist are highly revered. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mande_pagan_DESC;The Serer religion, or Fat Roog ("the way of the Divine") are the religious beliefs, practices and teachings of the Serer people of Senegal in western Africa. The Serer believe in a universal Supreme deity called Roog, but also worship the pangool (the spirits) and practise astronomy and cosmology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_DESC;A religion based on the teachings of Mani, a prophet originally from Persia. Similarly to Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism features a conflict between light and darkness. With Manichaeism, however, the conflict is mainly internal, and the struggle of good vs. evil is characterized by the struggle between Primal Man and Satan. It also plays out over the world, but things like the earth and the flesh are not seen as inherently good or evil, but rather possessed by light or darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_ahriman_DESC;A cult worshipping the Manichaean king of darkness, Ahriman, in an effort to bring about total darkness on the world. Followers of Ahriman seek to throw away the balance between shadow and light in the world and bring back the World of Darkness, the realm of their master, that existed since primordial times. They will fight zealously against all those who stand in their way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_germanic_DESC; A syncretic Germano-Manichaean faith. It features the traditional light vs darkness dualism element shown in all other Manichaean religions. The traditional Germanic focus on Wodanaz moves to a deity known as Auzawandilaz, "the luminous wanderer", who wages eternal war against the forces of the Muþspell, "the world destroyers". Their conflict is said to end in a cataclysmic event that will cover the world in flames, but thanks to Auzawandilaz humanity will endure and rebuild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_mithra_DESC;Theomachianism is a syncretic faith composed by many elements of Graeco-Roman mythology, Manichaeism, and Mithraism via its great success within the Roman military, turning to the idea that the world is the battleground of the Gods and that all life is part of the Battle between life and death, light and shadow, and that each mortal must give their all in the fight against the forces of darkness. Theomachians believe that all those who do not partake in their endeavour are servants of darkness and are to be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_slavic_DESC;Dragomirism is a Local Gnostic religion of Populist soul with a strong Slavic ascendant. Created by the Manichaean priest Dragomir in the latter half of the 9th Century CE, Dragomirism claims that the universe is an arena of eternal war between the Creator God (often identified with Rod) and the evil, chaotic dragon Zmey. Zmey is the creator of the material world, which he planned to use to corrupt the Creator God's pure divine creation. According to Dragomirist theology, humans are the only material beings possessing a soul - and as such are the only ones that can stand up against Zmey in this eternal struggle. Dragomirist beliefs incorporate the majority of Slavic pantheon - deities like Perun, Svarog and Dazhbog are lesser beings who attempt to harness Zmey's matter and turn it against its master. Dragomirists constitute small autonomous communities sharing all material properties, centered around the performing of esoteric rituals aiming at exorcising Zmey and bringing forth spiritual purity in this world. These Dragomirist communities are enthusiastic to fight Zmey's servants, but they often make for extremely unruly subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
marabout_DESC;A sect of Islam with the belief that true religious education and prosperity requires the use of a marabout (a religious teacher or leader). The marabout is often an expert on Islam and the Qur'an, and his followers adhere to him as they would to a prophet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
marcionist_DESC;Marcionism is a Local Christian creed of Scholarly soul, with strong Gnostic influences. Marcion of Sinope was a bishop who was living in Pontus during the times of early Christianity. Influenced by Gnostic dualist theory, he believed and taught that the wrathful Hebrew god Yahweh was a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament.  For Marcionists, Christ was not the Jewish Messiah but a spiritual entity that was sent by God to reveal the truth about existence, and thus allowing humanity to escape the earthly trap of the demiurge Yahweh. In spite of strong doctrinal opposition from the official Church, Marcionism remained predominant in the relatively isolated Pontus area, where it developed in isolation from other Christian currents. A particular feature of that creed is the development of a thorough alternative canon of scriptures, compiled even before the Catholic canonical Gospel. Believers emphasize the analysis of the Marcionist canon, composed of eleven books, which provide keys for analyzing this world in a moral, almost platonic perspective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mari_christ_DESC;Euskalism is a Local Christian movement of Traditional soul with a Barbarian ascendant. Euskalism is a hybrid religion focusing on the belief that the Virgin Mary was the incarnation of Mari, the goddess of the Euskal people. The movement developed in Euskalia as a local synthesis between Arianism and more ancient local beliefs. Believers follow many Christian beliefs and practices but put a heavy emphasis on the veneration of Mari (also equated with the Virgin Mary). Each village or community follows the spiritual directions of a virgin crone, often a kind of village elder, whose religious influence supercedes that of the standard Christian clergy. Traditionally, it is only the virgin crones who have the authority to select and give sacraments to Euskalist priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maturidi_DESC;An Islamic school of thought that broke off from the Ash'ari school, founded by Abu Mansur Al Maturidi. The main premise is that, contrary to Ash'ari ideology, belief (iman) does not change, but rather piety is what increases and decreases. Both the Ash'ari and Athari sects believe that iman does increase and decrease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdakism_DESC;A heresy of Zoroastrianism as brought about by Mazdak, a religious prophet. According to Mazdak, humanity should enjoy the pleasures of life and satisfy their appetite in the highest degree in regards to eating and drinking in the spirit of equality, as well as to aim at good deeds, abstention from causing harm to others, and practicing hospitality without reservation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
melkite_DESC;The Melkite Church is a Heretical Christian creed of Clerical soul. Melkites view themselves as the first Christian community, dating the Melkite movement back to the time of the Apostles. During the bitter debates occurring at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE, the official Church imposed its vision of a dual nature of the Christ. This declaration sparked tensions among Syriac Christians. The anti-Chalcedonians (mostly rural Syriac speakers) accused the Chalcedonians (mostly Hellenized urban dwellers) of following the Pope, or "king" (in Syriac, "malka"), and thus called them "Melkites". In the 8th century, when Leo III and his successor Leo Constantine organized violent persecutions against Christians, the Melkites negotiated relative respite for their communities by supporting the emperor's agents. The Pope had no choice but to excommunicate them, and the Melkite clergy in turn declared the church in Rome heretical while delivering those loyal to the Pope to the Imperium Romanum's persecution. This treason to their brothers in faith isolated the Melkite community, but allowed it to survive up to today in the midst of a hostile environment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mithra_DESC;A cult venerating Mithras, a Graeco-Roman diety based off the Zoroastrian divinity of covenant and oath, Mitra. Worshippers of Mithras have a complex system of seven grades of initiation, with ritual meals. Iconic scenes of Mithraic mythology include Mithras being born out of rock, him hunting and slaughtering a sacred bull with his bare hands and holding banquets with Sol. Very popular with the Roman soldiery, various military enclaves of the former Roman Empire now hold Mithraism as their state cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mithra_christ_DESC;A heretical sect of Mithraism which believes that Jesus of Nazareth was the incarnation of Mithra, "Mithras-Christos". It combines many Mithraic and Christian elements. But the core belief is that Christ is Mithra made flesh as Redeemer of the World. Mithraic-Christianity is very different in its message in that it is highly militant, the faithful believe in sacrificing themselves in "fighting evil" at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mithra_sol_DESC;Eosphorism is an union of Mithras and Sol into a new figure Eosphoros - The Dawn Bringer. Elements of the Judaeo-Christian tradition are also included, Eosphoros is Lucifer, and a direct Enemy of Christianity. Eosphorism sees the Dawn Bringer as the True God and Creator of Humanity, with Christianity being an abomination to be exterminated. It is a highly militaristic anti-Christian religion. Partly as a reaction against-Christianity, Eosphoros becomes Lucifer. Part of his mythology is centered around his Battle with Yahweh and Christ. He is the true Creator of Humanity and Redeemer, the Fallen God, rising again in the Morning. He overcomes Yahweh who is seen as an Opressor God, to help liberate humanity and bring Salvation. He is a Lord of Hosts, a Battle-Lord of the Morning, locked in battle with Yahweh, until his future victory and Redemption of Humanity in His Light. Followers believe that Eosphoros' light will bring harmony to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monophysite_DESC;Monophysitism is a Mainstream Christian denomination of Clerical soul. It is a byproduct of the theological School of Alexandria, which began its Christological analysis with the eternal Son, the Word of God made flesh, and sought to explain how this eternal Word had come to Earth as a man. Monophysites claim that, after the union of the divine and the human in the historical Incarnation, Jesus Christ, as the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, had only a single nature which was either divine or a synthesis of divine and human. Monophysitism was condemned by the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE, in which the Definition of Chalcedon, which maintains that Christ maintained one divine nature and one human nature after the Incarnation, was adopted. The Chalcedonian settlement encountered strong resistance in the Eastern fringes of the Roman Empire, leading ultimately to the schism of the Oriental Orthodox churches. The Monophysite Church took root where local kings were trying to differentiate themselves from the official Roman church, mainly in the Caucasus and Aegyptus. The Monophysite Church thrived and organised itself in these distant locations. Monophysites have developed their own rites and use clearly differentiated divine liturgies and iconographies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monothelite_DESC;A sect of Orthodox Christianity that believes that Jesus had two natures (one divine, one human) but one will. This is in contrast to the common belief that Christ had two wills and two natures, relatively corresponding to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
montanist_DESC;Montanism is a Heretical Christian sect of Clerical soul, with a heavy Graeco-Roman ascendant. Its founder Montanus, a mystic from Phrygia, launched a movement called "The New Prophecy" in the 2nd Century CE. This "New Prophecy" spread rapidly to other regions in the Roman Empire at a time when Christianity was not yet recognized or tolerated in the Western Empire. Montanus was a recent convert when he first began receiving revelation. He believed he was a prophet of God and asserted that New Jerusalem would appear in Phrygia. He insisted the Holy Trinity had precedence over Jesus, who he claimed was a mere initiator of his own prophecies. During his divinations, Montanus emulated the oracles of the Graeco-Roman world and spoke in the first person as God, claiming direct divine inspiration. Montanism remains a movement focused around prophecy, specifically the prophecies of the ininterrupted lines of "New Prophets", chosen at each generation by the Wise Amongst The Wise. These prophecies, formulated from the Montanist Oracle in Phrygia, are believed to contain the Holy Spirit's revelation for the present age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
murjiah_DESC;A school of Islamic thought that focuses on the idea that only Allah has the right to judge others, and that sin and "levels of believerhood" should not be such an important factor to Muslims, as Muslims should regard all other Muslims as believers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutazil_DESC;An Islamic school of theology based on reason and rational thought. There is an assertion that, because God is perfect and divine, the Qur'an must have been created and therefore cannot be co-eternal with God. From this premise, the Mu'tazili school of thought proceeds to posit that the injunctions of God are accessible to rational thought and inquiry: because knowledge is derived from reason, reason is the "final arbiter" in distinguishing right from wrong. It follows, in Mu'tazili reasoning; that "sacred precedent" is not an effective means of determining what is just, as what is obligatory in religion is only obligatory by virtue of reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neoplato_DESC;A monistic religion based around the teachings of Plato. Essentially, the beliefs include the belief in the One and Infinite, the source of all life in the universe. Since it is beyond the level of Being, it cannot be understood or comprehended, according to Plato. Since it is beyond Being, it is limitless, attribute-less, and magnitude-less. It is neither good nor bad, as morality would imply limitation. The One emanates nous, the perfect image of the One. This nous is simultaneously being and thought, and could be summarized by pure intellect. This is the highest level obtainable by man, and the nous corresponds perfectly to the One but is distinct and separate, as nothing reaches the level of the One. Under the One, there are three levels of celestial hierarchy: the Hypercosmic Gods, who make Essence, Life, and Soul, the Demiurge, known as the creator, and the Cosmic Gods, who make Being, Nature, and Matter. The last category would include the gods known in other pantheons. In a way, Neoplatonism is a philosophical religion with several pantheistic elements. There is no belief in an afterlife, but "salvation" (perfection and happiness) could be obtained through philosophical thought. There is no concept of evil, as it is comparable to darkness – which only exists in the absence of light. Good can be obtained through existence, which is complex in the sense that philosophical thought is the path to Good. Evil would exist without that, so ignorance would be Evil. The only "afterlife" per se that exists in Neoplatonism is the return to the Source (the One), essentially becoming part of the One. Impure souls would return to the Earth for a purification, which involves being reincarnated into a new body (human or animal). When a soul reaches the Source, they have achieved union with the universal cosmic soul and never need to return to Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nestorian_DESC;Nestorianism is a Mainstream Christian religion of Messianic soul, with strong Persian influences. It originates from the theological School of Antioch, which based its Christology on the human Jesus of the Gospels and sought to explain how this man had become united with the eternal Word in the Incarnation. Nestorius, the bishop of Constantinople in the 5th Century CE, emphasized the disunion between the human and divine natures of Jesus. The Church rejected these teachings and exiled him. Fleeing both the Church and the Eastern Emperor Imperator Alexandros X's persecutions against all sorts of Christians - heretical or not - Nestorius and his supporters relocated to Sassanid Persia. They affiliated with the local Christian community, which became increasingly Nestorian in doctrine. Persian scholars expanded on the teachings of Nestorius and his mentors, particularly after the relocation of the School of Edessa, a theological school of great importance to the Syriac speaking world, to the Persian city of Nisibis in 489 CE. Throughout the 6th Century, the church was frequently beset with internal strife and persecution from the Zoroastrians, and even experienced a schism it could hardly overcome. Eventually, the church emerged stronger after this period of ordeal, and increased missionary efforts in spite of complex relationships with the Persian rulers. Indeed, the Sassanid dynasty has developed a patronizing attitude to the Nestorians, seeing them as "good Christians" out of the realm of Lie, if yet not fully enlightened - a pragmatic doctrine which they used to gain support from their own Nestorian minority and impose Nestorianism as the leading Christian church, under strong control by the State. With the weakening of the Sassanid dynasty, the Nestorian church is now free from any form of State control. Nestorian clerics are convinced that a new golden age has arrived, and the Church has entered the 11th Century full of ambition and ready to unite the peoples of the East under the sign of the Cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_christ_DESC;Scandinism is a Local Norse religion of Statist soul, with strong Christian influences. Viking raids on Frankish kingdoms and the British Isles brought the Scandinavians in contact with Christianity. Some of the Forn Siðric rulers decided to formally embrace Christianity as they seek a broader source of legitimacy than the old tribal links. Thus Norse Christianity, or "Scandinism", respects the official Catholic Church as long as it does not mingle into its own business, while adapting its message to the specific Norse culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_pagan_DESC;The polytheistic religion of the Norse people. Many gods and goddesses are worshipped and venerated, and even though adherents may specialize their worship to a particular god or goddess, all deities in the pantheon are believed in. Practices include ancestor worship and remembrance, blots, and sacrifices -sometimes humans. Other mythological creatures, such as giants, dwarves, elves, etc. are also a part of this religion. There are also nine homeworlds which the followers believe the gods used to shape the world we live in today: Midgardr (land of the humans), Asgardr (land of the Aesir), Vanaheimr (land of the Vanir), Jotunheimr (land of the giants), Alfheimr (land of the elves), Hel (land of the dead), Svartalfaheimr (land of the dwarves), Niflheimr (land of ice), and Muspellsheimr (land of fire).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_war_DESC;Literally "Gods of War", the Ófriðartívar cult is an off-shooting branch of Norse mythology focusing on the veneration of the war gods of Norse legends: Odin, Tyr, and Freya, with a strong emphasis on their roles as mighty warriors. Adherents believe that if they worship these gods specifically, they will be granted victory in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orthodox_DESC;Orthodoxy is a Mainstream Christian religion of Statist soul. The principal belief, shared with all other Christian creeds, is that prophet Jesus of Nazareth, living in the 1st century CE, was the son of God who died on the cross and was resurrected to redeem the whole of humanity and deliver it from sin. Still, continous theological disputes fuelled by political divergences - about the nature of the Trinity and the Holy Spirit or organisation of the Church - have resulted in gradual splintering. The Pope Benedict VIII's preaching of a crusade against the Eastern Empire has resulted in the Great Schism of 1019 CE, when high Christian officials decided to support their Emperor rather than follow the Pope's call to revolt. This move has resulted in Orthodoxy severing all ties with the Roman Catholicism, an unprecedented division. The Eastern Roman Empire, although generally hostile to Christians, took the pragmatic step to support the institutionalization of the Orthodox Partiarchate in Orchid in order to limit the subversive influence of Rome's spiritual leadership over its own Christian population. Compared to Roman Catholicism, Orthodoxy has a much more sophisticated cult of sacred images ('icons'), a strong monastic movement with emphasis put on ascetic practices and a very decentralised internal organisation. While Roman Catholics follow the pope's authority, each Orthodox community has an autonomus patriarch, with the ecumenical patriarch considered to be first among the equals. Not having a strong independent church organisation, Orthodox patriarchs tend to rely on local rulers for material backing, and generally develop mutual legitimation relationships with relevant political authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
palmyran_pagan_DESC;The indigenous religion of the Canaanites. Elohimi is a polytheistic religion, with some monolastic (recognizing many gods, but worshipping one or a few) tendencies. The main gods of the Elohimi pantheon are Ba'al (the king of the gods), Attar (god of the morning star), Melqart (god of the underworld), Mawat (god of death);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
peckols_DESC;A cult worshipping the two deities of the underworld, Peckols and Patollo. The two are actually one god, formed in two separate entities. The god(s) is/are seen as an angry, evil spirit, known for haunting and taunting the living if the dead were not buried with proper rituals or if the living disobeyed the pagan priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pelagian_DESC;Pelagianism is a Heretical Christian religion of Clerical soul. Originating from the theology of the monk Pelagius in 380 CE, Pelagians hold that Adam never incurred any "original sin", only that he set a bad example for humanity. Consequently, humanity is not doomed to sin, but instead chooses to sin of its own free will. Therefore, the "original sin" did not taint humanity and mankind is capable of choosing right and wrong without need of divine aid. This belief directly opposes that of the Catholic Church, which claims that man is inherently evil and that man cannot come to God without the grace of God, symbolized by the Baptism. The Pelagian believers have their own well-structured clergy and are deeply convinced of the heretical nature of mainstream Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
perkunas_DESC;The polytheistic religion of the Baltic peoples, with the god of thunder, Perkunas, as the king of the gods. Dievas is also seen as a supreme god, but in the mainstream doctrine of Baltic paganism, Perkunas has a level of admiration that Dievas does not quite reach, mostly due to his rivalry with the devil. The devil, rather than a malevolent, all-encompassing, corrupting evil, is seen more as a trickster, stealing cattle and weapons, and then hiding in rocks and trees. When Perkunas comes to do battle, it is in the form of a thunder-storm, after which weapons and cattle are returned. Perkunas is also seen as the creator of weapons, or at least the concept of weaponry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
perun_DESC;The worship of Perun is a Mainstream Slavic religion of Martial soul. Perun is the creator and god of lightning, as well as ruler of the world. He is usually depicted as a tall man with a golden moustache, a silver head, a copper beard, and armed with a mighty axe. Under Nordic influences, most Slavs tend to grant him a loose prominence among all their Gods. The cult doesn't have established temples - believers convene at sacred oak woods, where they sacrafice oxen and other livestock. Perunic adherents believe he is also the god of light, fighting an eternal struggle against Veles - the god of underworld. It is said that whenever a lightning strikes, it was an attempt by Perun to kill Veles. Believers take it upon themselves to take part in this holy struggle againt Veles' servitors and other enemies to the Will of Perun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plato_christ_DESC;A hybrid-religion resulting from the meld of Christianity and Neoplatonist ideas. Emphasis could be on Jesus' existence as a Cosmic God, or perhaps God as one of the Cosmic Gods. Perhaps a similar take on Christ as featured in Porphyryanism, only more on the divinity of Christ rather than the rejection of Christianity altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plato_islam_DESC;A hybrid-religion resulting from the meld of Islam and Neoplatonist ideas. Emphasis could be on the inconceivability of the True Nature of God, as well as Mohammed's principles and writings in the Qur'an being taken as the path of the One, or even Allah being one of the Cosmic Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plato_pythagorean_DESC;A synthesis of Neoplatonism and the teachings of Pythagoras. There is a strong emphasis on the application of mathematics to the universe, both physical and spiritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
porphyryan_DESC;An anti-Christian sect of Neoplatonism founded by Porphyry of Tyre. Porphyry advocated that "the Gods have proclaimed Christ most pious, but the Christians are a confused and vicious sect", and as a result there is much disdain for Christianity in this sect of Neoplatonism. Porphyryans also practice vegetarianism on both spiritual and ethical grounds, under the belief that animals are as sentient as human beings, as enforced by mainstream Neoplatonism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
priscillian_DESC;Priscillianism is a Heretical Christian sect of Messianic soul, with a strong Gnostic influence. Priscillian was an Iberian ascetic mystic living in the fourth Century, who regarded the Christian life as continual intercourse with God. He created an ascetic group which thrived in spite of his execution for heresy. Its dualistic doctrine is based on the belief in the Kingdoms of Light and Darkness. Angels and men are from the Kingdom of Light and made from matter taken from God. Men received the mission to destroy the Kingdom of Darkness, but they fell and were imprisoned in human bodies. Thus both kingdoms are represented in men: the light by the Twelve Patriarchs which correspond to man's powers, and the darkness by the signs of the Zodiac and matter. Since the Twelve Patriarchs could not free man, Jesus was sent in a mortal body to release man from the curse of earthly matter. The salvation of man consists in liberation from the domination of matter, and at the center of Priscillianism is a strong call to a life of personal piety and asceticism, including celibacy, vegetarianism, and abstinence from alcohol.  This doctrine has always been under harsh repression from the mainstream Church, but the power of its ascetic message serves as the foundation for this deeply rooted sect. Priscillians do not attend churches integrated to villages and cities for their religious ceremonies, as most other Christians do. Instead, Priscillan priests organize religious and social life within the confine of a network of impregnable fortresses, which they initially developed to resist repression and invasions. Within the austere stone walls, they impose tenuous ascetic practices on themselves and their community, requiring extreme self-control in a spiritual as well as physical sense. These practices are based as much on studies of the secret scriptures as on stern training in the arts of war and murder in the name of the Christ of Light. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
qarmatian_DESC;A fanatical sect of Islam under the idea that a utopian Islamic republic could be formed. Vegetarianism is also one of the major practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ragnarok_DESC;The Ragnarökic cult focuses it's worship on Fenrir - the wolf destined to devour Odin - and his sons, Hati and Skoll. The Ragnarökic see the Aesir as gluttonous corrupts and the Vanir as debauched revellers. They believe that during the end of time, the Ragnarök, Fenrir will devour the Aesir, the Vanir and their corrupt realms of Ásgarðr and Vanaheimr and afterwards rule the renewed Miðgarðr with those that stood by his side, purged of the tainted influence of the Aesir and Vanir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rod_DESC;The worship of Rod is a local variation of the Slavic religion of traditional soul. Rod is the oldest Slavic deity, the creator of the universe and all other gods. Even though Nordic influence resulted in some Slavs accepting Perun as a chief deity, more traditional tribes still worship Rod the Creator, as they did centuries ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
roman_imperial_DESC;A state cult focused around the veneration of former rulers of prominence, specially prevalent in the remaining Roman enclaves. Important historical Roman figures like Megas Alexandros, Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar are officially venerated as deities, offered sacrifices to, and considered "patrons of the state". Other important local figures might be also venerated alongside the generally accepted great rulers. The priesthood is highly organized under a a Pontifex Maximus who regulates all the worship and sacrifices to these "deities" under the auspices of the ruler, who is also considered divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sabellianist_DESC;A heretical sect of Christianity founded by Sabellius, whose doctrine states that God is one indivisible being and the forms of Jesus and the Holy Spirit were both outward manifestations of God as he chose to appear to mankind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
saule_DESC;A sun-worshipping religion variant based off of Baltic paganism, in which Saule, the sun god, is worshipped in a monotheistic fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
semipelagian_DESC;Semipelagianism is a Local Christian creed of Clerical soul. It was developed as a compromise between Pelagianism and the teachings of the Church. Pelagianism opposes mainstrean Catholicism by stating that mankind is capable of choosing right and wrong without need of divine aid, while Catholicism teaches that man cannot come to God without the grace of God. The Semipelagian compromise states that beginning of faith is free will, but the growth of faith is God's work. This is contrary to the common Catholic belief at the time that the beginning of faith requires an initiative from God, but the rest is free will. Thus, according to Catholicism, no one can merit the initial grace of forgiveness associated with conversion, as Semipelagians attempt to convey. In practice, Semipelagian communities have their own well-structured clergy and their rites have evolved in a distinct way, although they are not as radical as Pelagians in opposing mainstream Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
set_DESC;A Egyptian sect that worships Sutekh, also known as Set, the god of the desert storms and disorder. The sect flourished during the oppressive reign of an Atenist ruler. The followers of Sutehk seeked to topple the corrupt Atenist leadership and bring about a renewed world born from the red sands. Their power has dwindled since Atenism's influence was reduced, but a few still cling on to carry on the will of their deity. He has a positive role in the traditional Egyptian faith where he is employed by Ra on his solar boat to repel the serpent of Chaos Apep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sethian_DESC;The Sethoitae ("followers of Seth") are a Local Gnostic cult of Traditional soul, with significant Jewish influences. According to the Sethoitae mythos, the material world was created by the demiurge Yaldabaoth, who in turn was a creation of Sophia - an emanation of the Only God's wisdom. Yaldabaoth has created the Earth, assisted by his subordinates - the Archons - and tricked mankind into believing he is the Only God. His greatest creation is Adam and Eve's third son - Seth - who unwittingly inherited divine powers Yaldabaoth had stolen from Sophia. According to Sethians, Jesus of Nazareth was Seth's reincarnation, and his earthly mission was to reunify human souls - particles of Light dispersed in the world - with the divine world called Pleroma. Since the Light is timeless and eternal, Sethians cherish tradition, upholding ceremonies and beliefs described in the scriptures. They are steadfastly orthodox, considering every change as yet another corrupted creation of Yaldabaoth, aimed to retake the divine powers Seth inherited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shams_DESC;A sect of the Arabo-Semitic faith that venerates Shamash, the Semitic sun god. This cult is the modern descendant of the ancient Babylonian and Assyrian cult of Shamash, and maintains it's strict priesthood. Priests are responsible for continuing the cultural and religious traditions of their city-states, and are viewed as mediators between humans and Shamash. The priesthood resides full-time in temple complexes, and administers to matters of state including the large irrigation processes necessary for civilization's survival, thus they have a high degree of control and autonomy from the ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shiite_DESC;Another major sect of Islam, differing from Sunni Islam in the belief that caliphates should be led by purified members of Muhammad's direct lineage. Practices also differ, largely in the prayer stone they use (following the belief that prayer should be closer to something naturally from the Earth, rather than a manufactured rug).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slavic_christian_DESC;Slavic Christianity is a Local Christian creed of Clerical soul, with strong Barbarian influences. Increasing influence of the Solar religions among Slavic peoples motivated the Catholic Church to pay due attention to this group of people emerging as the power broker of the distant eastern lands. The Pope sent twelve clerical envoys with a strong escort and lavish gifts to make their way to the eastern edge of the world for the sake of meeting, impressing, and converting the king of the Slavs. For three years, no news came to Rome from the Papal embassy. Eventually, an Audianist merchant from Caffa brought one of the chests back with the heads of eleven of the envoys. No more was heard from the Slavs for twenty-nine years, until a delegation came presenting themselves as envoys of the Bishop of the Holy Church of the Slavs. How the last of the twelve envoys could succeed is not clear, but a semiautonomous Christian church for the Slavs emerged. It first organized itself underground, without support from any ruler or the rest of Christendom. As a result, the Slavic clerics have started creating am organized clergy of their own, somwhow replicating the early Christian days when the Church had to hide from the Roman State.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slavic_pagan_DESC;The polytheistic religion of the Eastern Slavs, in which Rod is seen as the creator god and therefore the king of the gods; although in some groups, Svarog is worshipped as the principal deity. Other deities include Perun (god of thunder), Veles (god of the underworld), Jarilo (goddess of the moon), Dažbog (god of the sun), and so forth. Rituals include festivals throughout the year, namely seasonal festivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_DESC;The Solar-Imperial cult is a Mainstream Graeco-Roman religion of Statist soul. The central figure of the cult is Sol Invictus ("Invincible Sun"), incarnated in flesh as the Imperator of the Imperium Romanum. As such, the Imperator is percieved as a divine figure, having unquestionable authority in every matter, be it secular or spiritual. Since its introduction by Imperator Commodus in the 2nd Century CE, Solar-Imperialism became one of the most widespread and influential religions of the world, influencing religious systems from Britannia and Scandinavia all the way to Ethiopia. Two of the most distinguishing practices of the Sol-Imperial cult are the celebration of the 25th of December (Dies Natalis Sol Invictus - "Day of Invincible Sun's Birth") and the practice of "going into the desert" - a practice in which the aging emperor abdicates the throne in favour of his heir, so that the new Sun would rise once the old one sets. Still, peaceful transitions of power are rather unheard of - with most emperors either slain in battle or murdered by palace plotters, only a few actually left Constantinople to die peacefully in the arid wastelands of the Sahara. The central temple of Sol Invictus - the Hagia Sophia of Constantinople - is the greatest sacral building of the known world, dwarfing even the most majestic Islamic sanctuaries and the tallest Zoroastrian Temples of Fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_apollo_DESC;A Hellenic version of the worship of Sol Invictus, only with Apollo being the monotheistic god in focus. Unlike with Solar-Imperialism, followers of Apollo-Helios do not believe any emperor is Apollo-incarnate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_boreas_DESC;Apollo-Boreas is the union of Apollo, the sun god, and Boreas, the northern wind god, The Devouring One. Boreas was adopted as a patron by the Bosporan Kings - as a cruel unforgiving God he complements the benevolent side of Apollo - together they form a two-faced God reveling in the duality of good and evil. In the first half of the year, the Apollo facet is venerated for his warmth and the other half, Boreas is offered sacrifices to stave off the cold of winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_christ_DESC;Solar-Christianity is a Heretical Graeco-Roman religion of Statist soul, with significant Christian influences. Established in the 4th Century CE and popularised during the reign of Imperator Alexander VII, Solar-Christianity claims that the Christian prophet Jesus of Nazareth is the only true Sun incarnate and the son of God. While it does share basic elements with other Christian creeds, its pagan elements (such as the adaptation of Dies Natalis Sol Invictus as central holiday, or the personality cult of the Imperator as Christ's sole successor) make other Christian creeds treat their Solar brethren with suspicion and caution. While moderate Solar-Christians are usually tolerated by followers of the Invincible Sun, more radical elements tend to openly challenge the authority of the Imperators, seeing them as mere usurpers to Christ, who is to return during the Day of Judgement to purge the Earth of all evil. Solar-Christian monarchs enjoy undisputed authority - which stems from the Solar component, supported by Saint Augustine's theory of Civitas Dei (City of God) - according to which a strong secular state is required to protect the faithful from evil until the Day of Judgement comes and a pure Kingdom of God is created.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_islam_DESC;Al-Shams Islam is a Local Islamic sect of Statist soul, with strong Graeco-Roman influences. When Muawiya established control over the lands conquered by the Muslims, he found the wide array of spiritual affiliations present in Judea (the crossroad of empires) both a liability and an opportunity. Challenged by both heathens and the first divisions within Islam, which were encouraged by covert Roman actions, he reacted by blurring the lines of division between all the religions under his control. Making only vague references to Muhammad as the first among a lineage of God's messengers, he controlled tightly the emerging clergy, stopped the codification of Islam into canon holy texts and established himself as the only "Commander of the Faithful." His spiritual message, garbed in typically Roman monarchical allure, combined ambiguously Muhammad's oral legacy with Manichaean and Solar components so as to establish himself as the rallying point of all sects persecuted in the Roman and Sassanid empires, while reuniting the Muslim faithful. Many of his senior advisors were open worshipers of Sol Invictus. Later on, Umayyad caliphs would finally establish a more formal and less tolerant form of Islam. Under the influence of an increasingly powerful clergy, some within the realm of Islam - particularly in the deserts of Palestine around Nabatea where various heretical sects thrived far away from civilization - refused the new orthodox Qur'an and interpretation of the Prophet's life as innovations made up by strangers from the genuine Muslim community to justify their own bide for power. Mu'awiya's offspring, excluded from the palace politics in Damascus but still strong in Nabatea, seized the opportunity and referred to him as both heir of Muhammad  and the reincarnation of Alexandros XV (martyred during the Muslim siege of Alexandria, and whose return was expected by various Solar and Solar-Christian sects). In this double legacy, the true message of the Solar God, as revealed first to Muhammad, was made clear: all the empires of men but the Realm of the Faithful will be brought to dust by the burning wrath of God, and believers should follow the holy lineage stemming from Muawiya. In many aspects, the key beliefs of Al-Shams Muslims appear, to be paradoxically consistent with the Qur'an as codified by their Sunni enemies, but yet they follow a radically different interpretation of the holy text, emphasizing the Solar elements in Allah and his Word, minimizing the importance of Muhammad, refuting all hadith and the location of the Muslim holy cities in Hijaz. Refusing to lay down the Solar God's holy message in writing, they instead worship their Monarch, Son of the Sun, Shadow of God on Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_mani_DESC;A hybrid-religion that worships Sol Invictus as the God of Light in Manichaean fashion, fighting against Ahriman, the king of darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_norse_DESC;The worship of Odin-Sol is a Local Norse cult of Statist soul, with strong Graeco-Roman influences. Increasing contacts with the Roman Empire by Varangian captains led to a sythesis between the traditional Nordic deity Óðinn with the Roman cult of Sol Invictus. This synthesis makes Óðinn-Sól a patron of rulers, associated with victorious conquests and wise administration alike. The chief attribute of Óðinn-Sól is his single eye, representing the solar disc. It is said that Óðinn sacrificed his other eye to gain infinite wisdom, so that he can shine upon the world for only half of a day. Another chief belief is the so-called Ragnarök ("Twilight of the Gods") when the forces of darkness would rise against the Sun, and the next world would be born anew from the ashes of the previous. Solar eclpses are of particular importance for the followers of Óðinn-Sól, for  they believe that during each eclipse the forces of darkness attempt to strike against the Solar deity, only to be thwarted by Óðinn-Sól's divine power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_sahara_DESC;This religion belongs to the Fur migrants who settled in the area west of the Nile. Legend has it that while moving in the desert, the early Fur in the area came across pale-skinned men in ornate dress who appeared to be dying of thirst. When provided with aid, they said that they were tasked with escorting the Sun Emperor - whom they called "Sol Invictus" - into the desert as per their servitude to their Lord Made Flesh. They also said that he will return one day to rule forever. Basically, the nomads were fascinated by these strange light-skinned men and believed them to be celestial servants of this Sol Invictus. The men were revered by the tribe and essentially treated comparable to saints. As time and generations went on, light-skinned people became more and more familiar to the Fur and obviously they were no longer thought of as celestial beings, but rather held the place of the first missionaries to the Fur in spreading the will of Sol Invictus, and the initial men that were encountered are still regarded as messengers of Sol Invictus that were meant to be found by the Fur. This religion is not the same as Solar-Imperial because they do not recognize the validity of the current emperor, for they  believe that the true Sun Emperor will return one day, and all others are either imposters or placeholders until his return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_slav_DESC;The worship of Hors is a Local Slavic religion of Statist soul, with significant Graeco-Roman influences. Hors is the Slavic sun god, a personification of the solar disc. According to the mythos, Hors travels across the sky at day and moves underground at night, fighting off the monsters living there. One common Horsic belief is that red sunrises are caused by blood split by Hors during his noctural journey. Hors is interpreted as source of all light and life in the world - although the creation itself is usually attributed to Rod. Roman influence has resulted in partial association of Hors with Sol Invictus - each ruler is enthroned during sunrise, with prayers and offerings being made to Hors, protector of the realm. Additionally, the ruler is considered to have a special relationship with Hors, giving blessings on the god's behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_tsahay_DESC;An Ethiopian heresy based on Solar-Imperialism, in which Mahrem, the sun god and god of war, is worshipped in a monotheistic fashion. Much like in Solar-Imperialism, the ruler claims direct descent  from him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
solomonic_alexandros_DESC;When the cult of Alexandros-Amon spread its influence into Ethiopia, aspects were implemented into local Solomonic Christian communities. Alexandros would often be depicted as a saint in the church, sometimes as an archangel of Jah, even some go so far as to call him another incarnate of Solomon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
solomonic_christ_DESC;Solomonic Christianity is a Local Christian sect of Statist soul, with significant Archaic influences. The Ethiopian Church, although Christian, evolved under the prophetic rule of the Solomonid dynasty. It retains a stronger emphasis on the Old Testament and even integrates some elements from the Arabo-Sabaean religions, where ancient gods are merged with Biblical Prophets. Solomon is specially commemorated as a prophet almost the equal of the Christ, with the title of "Righteous Prophet and King". King Solomon seduced the Queen of Saba, herself descendant of Almaqah, the Sabaean sun god, and sired her son, Menelik I. He became the first Emperor of Ethiopia and brought the Ark of the Covenant, with divine assistance, to Ethiopia. The Solomonid dynasty, claiming descent from Solomon and the Queen of Sheba through Menelik I, thus perpetuates the rule of the House of David. Solomonic Christians believe the Solomonid dynasty and their state to be of divine nature, and see themselves as God's chosen people - the only legitimate perpetrators of the Alliance of the Old Testament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sowilo_DESC;The Norse version of the worship of Sol Invictus, with the monotheistic worship of the sun god (Sowilo) being the main tenet of this religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sufi_DESC;A heretical sect of Islam following an interpretation of worship of Allah based on the ihsan (perfection of worship) given to Gabriel by Muhammad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sunni_DESC;The largest branch of Islam, the religion founded by the prophet Muhammad. The main doctrines are the monotheistic belief in God (Allah), the absolute value of the Qur'an as the Word of God and Muhammad's status as the True Prophet of God, and the adherence to the Five Pillars of Islam: shahada (belief), salat (prayer 5 times a day), zakat (voluntary charity-2.5% to thoseless fortunate), sawm (fasting during the month of Ramadan), hajj (pilgrimageto Mecca). Unlike in Shi'a Islam, there is no clerical hierarchy in Sunni slam, although caliphates led by those elected by the Muslim community are respected forms of theocratic authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
svaroh_DESC;The worship of Svarog is a Local Barbarian religion of Statist soul, with significant Graeco-Roman influences. Svarog is the god of the celestial fire and blacksmithing, preserver of the holy fire which brought men out of the Stone Age. Recently, his cult gained popularity under strong influence of the Roman cult of Sol Invictus as princes make explicit connection between Svarog's civilizational role and their own authority - although no prince has ever tried to usurp solar glory in a way the Roman Imperators do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
svetovid_DESC;A warrior cult following the worship of Svetovid. Svetovidans believe that worship of Svetovid will bring them victory in battle, as with most warrior cults. Svetovid is seen as some as another form of Perun, but is not seen as the same being (by most, anyway). Key elements in this cult include divination, symbolism (usually involving a white horse, an image of Svetovid with a sword or bow in one hand and a drinking horn in the other, and idolatry involving pillars and offerings. There is also a Temple of Svetovid located on the island of Rujan, where a statue of Svetovid with four heads is located, and a horn of abundance is filled with fresh mead every year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
talab_DESC;A monolastic sect worshipping Ta'lab, the moon god. Since most travel was done at night, when it is cool, the moon plays an important role in the life of the people of the Arabian Peninsula. This sect though, has taken this a step forward: the sun god Almaqah is the unforgiving ruler of the heating Arabian day and his light searing, thus, they have fanatically set to bring about the eternal night where only the moon of their deity rules the skies alone. The followers of Ta'lab have a special enmity with the Almaqahi priesthood who exiled them out of Saba long ago, when the cult of Almaqah was fully established as the state religion of the kingdom of Saba. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tarhunt_DESC;The worship of Tarhunt is a Local Archaic religion of Martial soul. At the time of the reformation of the Luwian faith by the Isaurian emperor Leo III in the 8th century, frontier areas of the client-kingdom of Isauria followed a slightly different interpretation, originating from their long experiences of defending their realm against the threat of assertive neighbors. While recognizing the Sun Goddess Arinniti, they focus their attention on Tarhunt, the god of sky and storm, holding a triple thunderbolt and a double-headed axe, slayer of the evil dragon Illuyanka. Worshippers of Tarhunt consider themselves as the holiest of all Luwian, the first line of defense of their ancient civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
teiwaz_DESC;A Germanic cult following the monotheistic worship of Teiwaz, the Germanic god of war and fair rule. Being the god of fair rule and war, he favours the just, the honourable and the courageous rulers, and spurs the weak, lazy and wicked ones who don't fulfil their obligations in either rule or war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tengri_ahriman_DESC;The Ahriman-Tenrilists believe that the world is a battle between two forces - their particular side being that of Ahriman-Tengri. They believe that the world was created to be a battleground where they must prove their worth by striving for power, destroying their enemies, and also believe that the world is flawed and corrupted by the Great Opponent, the patron of decadent civilizations, and it is their belief that it should be remade and reforged in blood. They believe that the blood of their enemies feeds the sky and gives power to Ahriman-Tengri. The most zealous amongst them also believe that "if the sky is a desert, so should the world below be". To do this they conquer it and purge it of all those who would not bow to Tengri-Ahriman. They believe in the merciless extermination of their enemies, the purging of weakness, and continuous striving for power. Their greatest kings are considered to be incarnations of Ahriman-Tengri..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tengri_bud_DESC;A hybrid-religion resulting from the blending of Tengriism and Buddhism. Emphasis could be placed on an effort to achieve balance in the world and harmony as an effort to obtain enlightenment and break the cycle of samsara (life and death). It could also be believed that the Buddha was the incarnation of Tengri to bring forth the message of the True Faith to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tengri_mani_DESC;A hybrid-religion resulting from the melding of Manichaean beliefs and Tengriism. Emphasis could be placed on the practice of oneness with nature and balance through Tengri as an effort to reclaim good from the evil nature of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tengri_pagan_DESC;A steppe religion following the monotheistic worship of Tengri, the creator of the world. Tengri is often referred to as the Eternal Blue Sky, and there is a strong emphasis on harmony and balance with the world around oneself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tengri_rod_DESC;The worship of Rod Tanri is a Local Steppe belief of Statist soul, with significant Slavic influences. It combines the worship of Gokh Tanri, the Turkic sky god, with the Slavic creator deity Rod. Rod-Tanri is seen as the creator of the world and all minor gods, and he resides in high heavens. To oversee and guide his creation, he has given a mandate to the rightful Prince, whose duty it is to unite the known world under Rod-Tanri's glorious rule. The Rod Tanrili faith has a simple clergy system, featuring priests who mostly tend to congregation members and shrine maintenance, and shamans, who perform mystical rites to gain access to a higher plane of existence from where they can consult Rod Tanri himself on how best to fulfill his holy wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unctionist_DESC;Unctionism is Local Christian religion of Statist soul. The Capetian kings of Francia elevated the sanctity of kingship to the point where the king and a council of the bishops of the realm supplant the role of the Pope. This royal supremacy is symbolized during coronation. Like with the kings of the Old Testament, the coronation ceremony is the covenant between God and the Capetian sovereign: in exchange for divine unction by holy oil, the king promises to reign with justice, to protect his people, and to uphold the faith. This alliance took tangible form with the Sainte Ampoule, or Holy Flask. The Sainte Ampoule was brought to Saint Remi by a dove sent by God for the baptism of Clovis I, the first Frankish king to convert to Christianity. It gets miraculously refilled by God every time for each coronation of a true king, demonstrating the direct relation between God and the Frankish royal line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
valentinian_DESC;Valentinianism is a Local Gnostic sect of Scholarly soul, with a strong Christian ascendant. Valentinus was an early Christian gnostic theologian living in the 2nd Century CE who founded his own school in Rome when he failed to be selected for the bishop of Rome. The Valentinian theological system is extremely complicated and is kept secret to infidels. In the beginning, there was a Plemora (fullness) in which there was the Father. The Father projected thirty Aeons which joined into 15 syzygies, among them being Sophia (wisdom). Her curiosity and passion led to her fall from the Plemora and the creation of the world and man. Man must now recognize the Father as the true source of divine power in order to achieve gnosis, or knowledge. Only individuals of a spiritual nature (those following the truth revealed by Valentinus) can received the gnosis alloweing them to return to the divine Pleroma, while those of a psychic nature (the rest of the Christians) can only attain a lesser form of salvation, and that those of a material nature (non-Christian infidels) are doomed to perish.

teiwaz_reformed_DESC;The reformed worship of Teiwaz, Rextaz Siduz ("the Law Custom") becomes more dualistic with the inclusion of Teiwaz's father, Hymir.

While Zoroastrians believe in the creation of the universe from nothingness by Ahura Mazda the believers of Ptâ Zrvânahê believe that 'anything' cannot be created from nothing and such things as heaven, hell, reward, and punishment simply do not exist. Ahriman? Zurvan himself? Fabrications of the mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
