adoptionist_DESC;Adoptionism is local Christian creed of Clerical soul. Its doctrine teaches that Jesus lived like other men, and was most pious; but that at his baptism in the Jordan the "Christ" came down upon the man Jesus in the likeness of a dove. Only then did Jesus become God's son, chosen because of his sinless devotion to the will of God. Adoptionism would have remained an obscure heresy if not for the Catholic Church's failure to impose its unitary faith in Hispania. In 585, the Emperor of Hispania Saint Leogivild remembered as "the merciful", based in Toledo, converted to Catholicism, but his attempts to convert his vassal kings ushered in wide-scale rebellions. He defeated them thrice, forgiving them every time: they thanked him by eventually murdering him during a joint prayer in 590. In the great Toledo council of 595, in the midst of anarchy, Hispania's Kings found a compromise solution: they elected Leogivild's younger son Reccared, an Adoptionnist, while the Arian Euricing King of Leon famously proclaimed: "So called Catholic Monarchs have no place in Hispania." Adoptionism represented the least threatening of all faiths for the various Kings' autonomy. Elipandus of Toledo, archbishop of Toledo (717-808) further codified Adoptionism by teaching that Christ's human nature existed separately from His divine personhood. The condemnation of this doctrine in the Council of Ratisbon in 792 only served to strengthen its hold on the Castellan highlands, where nobles remain jealous of their autonomy from distant Pope and Emperors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aglibol_DESC;The worship of Aglibôl is a Local Archaic religion of Messianic soul. The meaning, in Aramaic, is “Calf of Baal”. Aglibôl is depicted with a lunar halo decorating his head and sometimes his shoulders, and one of his attributes is the sickle moon. The worship of Aglibôl is traditionally strongly associated with Beelshamen’s. In the first century, the Palmyran religion focused increasingly on the trio constituted by the supreme god Beelshamên, the sun god Malakbêl and the lunar god Aglibôl. Aglibôl was worshipped due to his shadow providing refuge from the sun and his moisture making desert orchards bloom in the early morning. Aglibôl is said to wage a continuous war against his brother Malakbel, whereby their father Beelshamen, or Ba'al Samem, keeps on a neutral stance, thus the cycle of day and night. Then came the time of the glorious Palmyrene Empire in the 3rd Century. The Emperor Odaenathus and his wife Zenobia conquered Syria, the Parthian capital and Egypt, worshiping Beelshamen in an increasingly monotheist fashion as a reflection of their own absolute dominion of the lands of men. The new religious doctrine elevated Beelshamen as a rival of Sol Invictus, Ahura Mazda and Yahweh. In this evolving cult, the new Palmyrene State attempted to merge the personality of all lesser Gods, including Aglibôl, in the overwhelming figure of Beelshamen. Sacrifices to Aglibôl were forbidden; His statues and other representations, removed from the main temples. This only led to Aglibôl acquiring a new spiritual appeal. Discontent nobles and their high clerical allies, who perceived absolute monarchy and monotheism as threats to their influences, consciously adhered to the worship of Aglibôl as a shadow cult, secretly gathering opponents to the new regime. As the ephemeral Empire collapsed, the followers of Aglibôl acquired more freedom and developed their own cult further, maintaining a clout of occult mystery around it to better infiltrate the official Beelshameni clergy. Aglibôlis prophesize that the time will come when the Moon God will vanquish the arrogance of the other Gods, topple Beelshamen as Lord of the Heaven and reward those who worshipped Him during the long night of His occultation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alexandros_DESC;The cult of Alexandros-Ammon is a Local Graeco-Roman religion of Martial soul, with significant Archaic influences. It centers around the worship of Alexandros III of Makedonia, also known as Megas Alexandros ('Alexander the Great'), who ruled Makedonia in 336-323 BCE. During the conquest of Aegyptus, Alexandros acquired a divine nature when he visited the Oracle of the Siwa Oasis, where he was proclaimed son of Zeus-Ammon, and 'Master of the Universe'. Henceforth, his cult grew with every following year, surviving even the dissolution of his empire in the wars of the Diadochi, and merging with the much more ancient worship of the Egyptian god Amun. His followers dream about the day when Alexandros-Ammon incarnate returns - this time to unify all the world under his leadership for all eternity. While limited mostly to Alexandros' descendants and a few communities, the cult of Alexandros-Ammon remains one of the oldest and most respected religions of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
allat_DESC;A monolastic cult worshipping Al-lat, an Arabian goddess of light and life, as a primary deity, but it also honors Al-‘Uzzá, goddess of love and beauty and Manat, goddess of destiny and death, her two sisters. Believers think that by keeping the traditions of their Goddesses, they convince the three sisters to maintain the balance between life, fertility and death. The cult of Al-Lat belongs to an Archaic Civilization, spiritual heir of the first religions born in the cradle of empires - Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent. Its Doctrine is a Local variation of a mainstream religious current, favoring social harmony over doctrinal purity. Its Soul is Traditional: the faith follows the ancient traditions of the commoners and local notables, and it has slowly evolved, if at all, throughout the recent era of troubles and turmoils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
allfather_DESC;Wodanazic is Germanic's paganism answer to the monotheism and dualism encountered in the nearby Christians and Manicheans by the nearby Sweboz and other Germanic tribes, elevating Wodanaz, the Allfather, to Supreme deity and Creator with all the others being merely lesser underlings. Elements of the Norse Odin have also been syncretized into him to increase his legitimacy as a superior amongst gods. Worship of Wodanaz belongs to a Barbarian Civilization, characterized by an emphasis on rural areas, individual martial prowess, and low division of labor. Its Doctrine is a Local variation of a mainstream religious current, favoring social harmony over doctrinal purity. Its Soul is Traditional: the faith follows the ancient traditions of the commoners and local notables, and it has slowly evolved, if at all, throughout the recent era of troubles and turmoils. It also has a Norse Ascendant, characterized by a strong emphasis on martial prowess and a focus on small holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
almaqah_DESC;The mainstream cult of the Arabian traditional faiths, a monolastic version of it which mainly venerates Almaqah, the Arabian male sun god, but almso recognizes the other deities. Almaqah is also considered the patron deity of the Saba Kingdom, and it's rulers are said to descend from him. The priesthood is well organized under the ruler, when compared to the other decentralized Arabian beliefs, due to the Sabaean being a metropolitan culture, rather than a semi-nomadic one like the rest of Arabia. The state cult of Almaqah belongs to an Archaic Civilization, spiritual heir of the first religions born in the cradle of empires - Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent. Its Doctrine is Mainstream: it is recognized as one of the main doctrinal systems in its most legitimate form. Its Soul is Clerical: the religion revolves around the many rules and rites set up by the clergy, which enjoys a privileged status in society and a large degree of autonomy from the Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amanai_DESC;The worship of Amanaii, Berber god of the setting sun. Megas Alexandros is often identified by the Berbers as Amanaii made flesh. The cult of Amanai belongs to a Barbarian Civilization, characterized by an emphasis on rural areas, individual martial prowess, and low division of labor. Its Doctrine is a Local variation of a mainstream religious current, favoring social harmony over doctrinal purity. Its Soul is Martial: heroic deeds on the battlefield are glorified as the finest sign of holiness. It also has a Graeco-Roman Ascendant, characterized by a strong interest in civic matters and well-organized military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amun_DESC;The cult of Amun-Ra is the state cult of the deity composed by Amun (king of gods) and Ra ( the sun god). Egpytian or Nubian rulers often claim to be his descendants, and this cult has been often the mainstream religion sponsored by the rulers of ancient Egypt. Other gods such as Horus, Isis and Sobek are also to be honored and worshipped by the ruler and priesthood for proper governance. The Egpytian cult of Amun-Ra belongs to an Archaic Civilization, spiritual heir of the first religions born in the cradle of empires - Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent. Its Doctrine is Mainstream: it is recognized as one of the main doctrinal systems in its most legitimate form. Its Soul is Statist: the faith is strongly infused with legitimation rethorics supporting political power, as the religion is instrumentalized by the Prince to strengthen its hold on society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
antinomian_DESC;Antinomianism is a Christian Heretical sect of Populist soul, with a strong Barbarian ascendant. It emerged in the 1st Century as a result of theological criticisms over the strict morale rules contained in the Old Covenant. According to some, moral law was of no use or obligation under the gospel dispensation of grace because faith alone was necessary to salvation. Under this theological guidance, some early Christian communities in Jerusalem are said to have practiced anarchist communism, sharing money, labor and women equally and fairly among the members, refusing any set of rules that they considered arbitrary. These early experiments, remembered by marginalized priests exiled to the fringes of Christianity, spurred a renewal among superficially-Christianized Goths when imperial authority weakened. In the ensuing chaos, new ambitious leaders looking for a mobilizing ideology met the radical preachers of the Antinomian revolution. The new Antinomian rulers claimed that Jesus' love, which is limitless, would wash away the sinful laws and hierarchies set up by the former Roman elite. Antinomianism is now a political and economic program as much as a religion, whereby believers combine Gothic tribal rituals with a new emphasis on moral nihilism, sexual freedom, and absolute collectivism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apollinarist_DESC;Apollinarism is a Local Christian creed of Clerical soul. Apollinarists follow the teachings of Apollinaris of Laodicea, a bishop in Syria during the 4th Century. The main principle is that Jesus could not have had a human mind, but rather a human body and a divine mind. This goes against the traditional view that Jesus had both a human body and mind, as culminated by his presence as the Son of God made flesh. Apollinarism was declared to be a heresy in 381 CE  by the First Council of Constantinople. Since Christ was officially depicted as fully human and fully God, followers of Apollinarianism were accused of attempting to create a tertium quid ("third thing"), neither God nor man. Apollinarius was a prolific writer and a charismatic missinary, and some clerics still follow his teachings, differenciating themselves from the mainstream Christian theology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arian_DESC;A Christian church founded by the presbyter Arius, emphasizing on the belief that Christ did not always exist, but as created by God, and is therefore separate from him. There is a strong belief in the disunity of the Trinity, and the supremacy of God over Jesus and the Holy Spirit.It became very popular amongst Germanic converts. Arian rulers use the rhetoric of Arius, specifically the supremacy of God amongst the other aspects of the Trinity to haver higher degree of control in the affairs of the church. Arianism belongs to the Christian Civilization, characterized by a focus on strong rural fortified holdings and special privileges to the clergy. Its Doctrine is Mainstream: it is recognized as one of the main doctrinal systems in its most legitimate form. Its Soul is Statist: the faith is strongly infused with legitimation rethorics supporting political power, as the religion is instrumentalized by the Prince to strengthen its hold on society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ashari_DESC;The Ash'ari school belongs to the Islamic Civilization, characterized by efficient tax systems and great cities but dynastic distrust. Its Doctrine is a Local variation of a mainstream religious current, favoring social harmony over doctrinal purity. Its Soul is Clerical: the religion revolves around the many rules and rites set up by the clergy, which enjoys a privileged status in society and a large degree of autonomy from the Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aten_DESC;The monotheistic worship of Aten, a Egyptian sun disk god. Originally part of the larger polytheist egpyptian tradition, Akhenaten made him into the single god to be worshipped. After his death, the worship was abandoned in all of his realm except outlying territories in Nubia and Darfur, where corrupt rulers used it as an excuse to oppress the tribes of the zone. Recently, the cult has resurfaced and Aten, still seen as the only god, is now so in a much military fashion, spurning idle and corrupt kings and favouring those strong in rule and battle. Atenism belongs to an Archaic Civilization, spiritual heir of the first religions born in the cradle of empires - Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent. Its Doctrine is Heretical, openly challenging the supremacy of a mainstream doctrine, either through the pen or the sword. Its Soul is Martial: heroic deeds on the battlefield are glorified as the finest sign of holiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
athari_DESC;The Athari school belongs to the Islamic Civilization, characterized by efficient tax systems and great cities but dynastic distrust. Its Doctrine is a Local variation of a mainstream religious current, favoring social harmony over doctrinal purity. Its Soul is Clerical: the religion revolves around the many rules and rites set up by the clergy, which enjoys a privileged status in society and a large degree of autonomy from the Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
attar_DESC;'Attar is a Semitic god of the morning star, rain and storms. In southern Arabia, one of his most known aspects is one of a god of war. There he's called "He who is brave in battle" , his symbol is a spearhead piercing the sun and his sacred animal is the antelope.  The cult of 'Attar  belongs to an Archaic Civilization, spiritual heir of the first religions born in the cradle of empires - Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent. Its Doctrine is a Local variation of a mainstream religious current, favoring social harmony over doctrinal purity. Its Soul is Martial: heroic deeds on the battlefield are glorified as the finest sign of holiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
audianist_DESC;Audianism is a Local Christian creed of Traditional soul. Audaeus was a theologian living in 4th Century Syria. In 325 CE at the First Council of Nicaea, he led the opposition to the official Church when it was decreed that all Christians should follow the Roman tradition of celebrating Pascha (Easter) at the Easter Sunday, and no longer at the date of 14 Nisan, like the Jewish Passover. The Audians complained that the church had "abandoned the fathers' Paschal rite in Constantine's time from deference to the emperor, and changed the day to suit the emperor." Audianist communities were later the target of sporadic persecutions, until Imperial authorities proposed to re-locate them North of the Black Sea where they would enjoy tolerance of their cult and act as a vanguard of the Imperial civilization. Since then, Audianists cling to their unique tradition, composed of outdated Christian rituals and nostalgia for the Syrian homeland they left centuries ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aztec_DESC;The polytheistic religion of the Nahua in which  Huitzilopochtli, the god of war, the sun, and sacrifice, is the primary deity. Human sacrifices are made to him daily in order for the sun to continue to rise.Tlaloc, the god of rain, is also an important deity, and child sacrifices are made to him on a mountaintop yearly. Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent deity, is believed to be the god of winds, as well as  a cultural hero in Aztec myths, most notably for fighting with Tezcatlipoca.Tezcatlipoca, the god of night, enmity and discord, and many other things, is also depicted in the form of a jaguar very often. The main festival for Tezcatlipoca, called Toxcatl, involves a young man being chosen by his parents and dressed up like Tezcatlipoca. The next year, he lived like a god, with four wives and eight servants.  At the end of that year, there would be a week-long festival in his honor, at the end of which he would climb the pyramid and be worshipped before being sacrificed by priests and eatenThe Aztec religion, Teotli, belongs to the Mesoamerican Civlization, characterized by a strong focus on agriculture, class distinction, and a heavy religious impact on daily life - particularly blood sacrifice. Its Doctrine is Mainstream: it is recognized as one of the main doctrinal systems in its most legitimate form. Its Soul is Martial: heroic deeds on the battlefield are glorified as the finest sign of holiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beelshamen_DESC;The worship of Beelshamen is a Mainstream Archaic religion of Statist soul. The antiquity of the worship of the god or gods of Baal extends back to the Bronze Age among the ancient Semitic peoples. The word Baal means "master" or "owner": Baal was once common a name of small Syrian and Persian deities. The Great Baal is the Canaanite god of storm and heavens, worshipped primarily in Palmyra and antique Carthage. In the first century, the Palmyran religion focused increasingly on the trio constituted by the supreme god Beelshamên, the lunar god Aglibôl, and the sun god Malakbêl. Beelshamên leads the triad: as the lord of heaven, he commands both the moon and the sun. Beelshamen was thus fervently prayed to for the protection of livestock and crops, as he is responsible for sun and rain, as well as droughts, plagues, and other calamities. The ancient religion acquired a new dimension in the 3rd Century as strong monotheist trends coalesced in the cult of Beelshamen during the glorious times of the short-lived Palmyrene Empire. In 260, with the Roman Empire in crisis, Odaenathus and his wife Zenobia, rulers of Palmyra, carved a vast Middle Eastern empire through a series of rapid and successful campaigns and ambitious foreign policies, conquering Syria, the Persian capital Ctesiphon and Egypt. As part of their empire-building efforts, they developed religious pride among their subjects by controlling the clergy and equating Beelshamen with Roman Sol Invictus and Persian Ahura Mazda. Beelshamen’s attributes, the eagle and the lightning bolt, became the symbols of the new State as expression of unchallenged authority wherever Palmyrene arms imposed its dominion. Both sovereigns made an explicit parallel between their exceptional deeds and Beelshamen’s supremacy among other, lesser Gods, claiming supremacy over lands worshipping other Canaanite or Phoenician deities. While the old Palmyrene Empire failed in its ambitious dream of gathering all Eastern cults into one, the memory of its glory is alive. The cult of Beelshamen retains a strong mystical aura in the lands once Palmyran and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bektashi_DESC;The Bektashi tariqat belongs to the Islamic Civilization, characterized by efficient tax systems and great cities but dynastic distrust. Its Doctrine is a Local variation of a mainstream religious current, favoring social harmony over doctrinal purity.

berber_pagan_DESC;The faith of the Amazigh, the Berber people, main gods include Mastiman (analogue to Greek Zeus), Amanai (analogue to Egpytian Amun) and Gurzil (analogue to Roman Mars). Practices  in  the Amazigh faith include elaborate burial rites, in which the dead are buried with burial with ostrich egg shells, weapons, and jewelry. The followers of the Amazigh faith also view the spirits of their ancestors to be gods, and will even spent the night in their tomb after asking questions. .The Amazigh faith of the Berbers belongs to a Barbarian Civilization, characterized by an emphasis on rural areas, individual martial prowess, and low division of labor. Its Doctrine is a Local variation of a mainstream religious current, favoring social harmony over doctrinal purity.

bogomilist_DESC;Bogomilism is a Local Gnostic religio-political sect of Populist soul.  It arose in Macedonia as a political movement in opposition to the social stratification brought by the Roman social structures and the official church. The Bogomils derive their name from their founder, the priest Bogomil (Theophilus) and the teachings of the Paulicans, a group of Manichaeans that settled in Thrace in the late 8th Century. Because grace could not bind itself to matter, Bogomils believe that Christ had only the semblance of a human body, and they reject the Eucharist and other sacraments, as well as relics and the use of material items in worship. Bogomils explain the earthly sinful corporeal life as a creation of Satan, an angel that was sent to Earth. Because of that, Bogomils are ascetic and tend to reject marriage, the eating of animal products, and anything created with materialistic or worldly goals in mind. Followers are called to refuse paying taxes, working in serfdom, or fighting for anything except the expansion of their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bud_gandharan_DESC;A form of Graeco-Buddhism with many aspects borrowed  from Greek culture, including the image of Buddha as an "ideal man-god", the incorporation of Cynicism into the concepts of zen and Madhyamika (a Buddhist school of thought teaching that all phenomena are without essence because they are "co-arisen"), and the figure of Maitreya, a future Buddha who is believed by some to be an interpretation of Mithra. As a result of it's Hellenisation, this form of Buddhism has a much more organized priesthood than other ramifications, and tends to be state sponsored and controlled. Gandharan Buddhism belongs to the Buddhist Civilization, characterized by a pacifist stance except for monasteries' warrior monks, and a strong interest for art and culture. It has an Indian Ascendant, characterized by weak feudal links, influential temples and a mysterious sensuality. Its doctrine is mainstream: it is recognized as one of the main doctrinal systems in its most legitimate form. Its soul is Statist: the faith is strongly infused with legitimation rhetorics supporting political power. Religion is instrumentalized by the Prince to strengthen its hold on society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bud_zor_DESC;Buddha-Mazdanism belongs to the Buddhist Civilization, characterized by a pacifist stance except for monasteries' warrior monks, and a strong interest for art and culture.

cathar_DESC;Catharism is Heretical Christian movement of Populist soul, with strong Gnostic influences. It developed in response to growing corruption in the Catholic Church. It has a strong influence from Manichaeism and early gnostic religions, and maintains close connections with the similar Bogomilst movement in the east. The Cathars are a direct challenge to the Catholic Church, renouncing Catholic practices and dismissing it outright as the Church of Satan. Rather than traditional sacraments, Catharism has only one sacrament: the Consolamentum, in which a brief ceremony is performed to remove all sin from the believer, or credentus, thus making them a perfectus. This sacrament must only be performed once, but perfecti must maintain a strong obligation of purity (and thus, many Cathars perform the Consolamentum on their death-bed). Purity in this life is attained through asceticism and strict moral rules. Sexual actions, even when sanctified by marriage, are abhorred on the grounds that the material world - including the flesh - is intrinsically evil, and thus Cathars largely reject the concept of marriage.  The Cathar society and church have a relatively flat structure, organized around bishops sharing the ascetic principles of their fellow believers and promoting the share of goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
catholic_DESC;Catholicism is a Christian Mainstream religion of Clerical soul. Catholics worship the prophet Jesus of Nazareth who sacrificed himself to redeem humankind from its sins, under the interpretation of the Church established by his follower Peter.

Under the Pope is the College of Cardinals, which consists of priests and other clergy appointed by the Pope. The Pope is elected from amongst the College of Cardinals when the former Pope dies. Catholicism consists of many tenets of faith, including purgatory, Christian sacraments, and the Pope's position as the divine spokesman for God on Earth. Rulers and clergy often butt heads over power, sometimes resulting in wars between the Papacy and other Christian realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celtic_christ_DESC;Hibernicism is a Celtic Local religion of Traditional soul, with strong Christian influences. Christianity arrived in Britain with the Roman legions in the 4th Century, but as the Roman presence remained unstable, local clerics reinterprated Christianity in a fashion more in line with their own Celtic traditions, creating a new variant of Christianity commonly called called Hibernicism. Old Celtic traditions kept alive by Druidism slowly became more and more intertwined, and as a result, Hibernicism developed into an ever-changing, peculiar synthesis between its fading Christian background and the revived Celtic belief system. In particular, characters of the Christian Saints and Celtic heroes influence each other, to the extent that the historical figure of Jesus of Nazareth is sometimes merged into one of the most prominent characters of the Celtic sagas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dazhbog_DESC;The worship of Dažbog is a Local Slavic denomination with Martial soul. Dažbog is the son of Svarog, creator and preserver of the holy fire. Unlike his father, however, Dažbog  represents the destructive, scorching aspect of the sun: Dažbog's realm is an eternal pyre, not unlike Satan's Hell, where he torments his enemies (especially Christians) until the end of times. His followers regard it as a most holy task to unleash Dažbog's wrath on their foes and go to war with impressive body painting representing the suffering promised to their enemies in the afterlife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

docetist_DESC;Docetism is a Local Christian faith of Scholarly soul. It derivates from an unorthodox interpretation concerning the meaning, figurative or literal, of a sentence from the Gospel of John: "the Word was made Flesh", under the influence of heterodox Judaism and ancient Oriental and Greek philosophies. Docestists believe that the phenomenon of Christ, his historical and bodily existence, and thus above all the human form of Jesus, was altogether mere semblance without any true reality. Jesus only appeared to be human, while in actuality he was a phantasmal projection from Heaven. While Docetism was unequivocally rejected at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, it remained alive among the learned of Eastern Anatolia, eventually becoming a popular creed among Armenian communities and rulers. Docetists emphasize skeptical interpratation of the mainstream Christian theology and seeking hidden truths concealed behind appearances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
donatist_DESC;Donatism is a Heretical Christian creed of Traditional soul, with a strong Berber ascendant. Donatus Magnus was a bishop in Carthage in the early 4th Century. He challenged the authority of the clergy appointed by the official Catholic hierarchy, on the ground that these clerics had surrendered their faith during times of persecution. After his death in exile around 355 CE, the parallel clergy put in place by Donatists increased its influence among Berber rural populations refusing the rule of Rome and of the official Catholic Church. The Circumcellions were bands of nomadic anti-Roman rebels and Punic-speaking bandits from the lower strata of society who supported Donatism and were sometimes led by Donatist clergy. Over the centuries, Donatism has flourished and evolved as a syncretic religion with nationalist elements, incorporating traditional Amazigh elements into Christianity and violently opposing the strict clerical and social hierarchy of the more-established Christian denominations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

There is no holy text for Suomenusko, but the epic folk tale of Finland (the Kalevala) is regarded as a source of information on the beliefs of the Suomenusko adherents. Many rituals common in other ethnoreligions, including sacrifice, bonfires, sacred groves, drinking toasts to the gods, and wooden idols are all elements of Suomenusko.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fraticelli_DESC;Fraticelli is a Local Christian sect of Populist soul. Named the "Little Brothers", this sect was formed in response to corruption in the Catholic Church. Their main opposition is to materialistic wealthiness exhibited by so-called Christians, going so far to say that a clergyman with wealth should have his clerical status nulled. A strong emphasis on poverty is capitalized in this sect, to the extent that private property baring the strict minimum is considered as wealth. Fraticelli apply this principle to individuals as well as to the church, and their ultimate goal is to clean the corrupt church and other devious creeds of their unholy devotion to wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
german_pagan_DESC;Literally meaning "the foremost custom", this religion basically refers to Germanic paganism before the influence of other religions. While German and Norse paganism share many similarities, the cultures, names, and practices are different, thus, to say Forn Sidr and Furistaz Siduz are the same religion would be inaccurate. Main gods include Wodanaz the Allfather, Teiwaz the god of war and fair rule, Þunaraz the thunder god and Frijjo, wife of Wodanaz and goddess of fertility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ghazi_islam_DESC;A sect of Islam with strong emphasis on the spread of Islam by the sword, if need be. Contrary to 'Ilm Islam, Ghazi Islam is a violent, zealous, and forced-theocratic religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Names and worship rituals/practices may vary between the two, but the gods are essentially the same for both. The primary deity is Zeus/Jupiter, the god of the heavens and thunder. Other deities include deities for fertility, the sea, agriculture, war, and many others. There are many other legends and demi-gods that are a result of relations between gods and mortals. One of the key features of the Graeco-Roman pantheon is the gods' human-like nature,something that is not found in many other major religions such as Christianity, Islam, and others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Ibadis also believe that those who enter Hell remain there forever, that Muslims will not see God on the Day of Judgment, and that the Qur'an was created by God at a certain point in time. Ibadis also tend to reject caliphates, seeing them as corrupt beyond the first two rightful caliphs (Abu Bakr and'Umar ibn al-Kha??ab).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
iconoclast_DESC;Iconoclasm is a Heretical Christian religion of Clerical soul, with significant Islamic influences. During the 8th Century, Islam was becoming more and more popular in Arabia and more and more Eastern Christians were beginning to adopt the Muslim custom of aniconism, or absence of religious images or statues. Politically, this would ease relations with Islam, but also clerically, the Iconoclasts believed that any depictions of Jesus Christ would be flawed, either by depicting Him as a purely physical being, or confusing His two natures as both God and Man. In the 8th and early 9th Centuries, Iconoclasm grew to power significantly, and many religious artifacts, paintings, and statues were destroyed by the zealots. The Clergy hold a paticularly high place in society, as they are often tasked with deciding whether an item is a genuine holy artifact, or a blasphemous copy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
illuyanka_DESC;The cult of Illuyanka is a Heretical Luwian faith of Traditional soul. According to ancient Hittite legend, the sky god Tarhunt defeated the serpent dragon Illuyanka in battle and emerged as the supreme divine entity. As the Isaurian Emperor Leo III reformed the beliefs of the Chosen People of Light (the Luwians) to adapt the creed to his imperial agenda, some remote communities led by Leo III's own bastard daughter resisted the changes brought by the religious reforms. Their doctrinal opposition went so far at to defy orthodox Luwian dogma by claiming that the dragon Illuyanka actually vanquished Tarhunt and emerged as the supreme divine entity, guiding his followers through the ages of darkness to come. Illuyankan worshippers maintain isolated, secretive, and defiant communities, resistant towards the external world - Luwian or else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ilm_islam_DESC;A sect of Islam with strong emphasis on the study and scholastic lifestyle of Islam. A very intellectual sect, many adherents are well-educated and devote their lives to the study of the Qur'an.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

indoh_bud_DESC;A syncretic religion in which Buddhist beliefs and values are incorporated into the already syncretic Indo-Hellenic faith. As a result, this form of Hellenic-infused Buddhism is highly organized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indoh_hindu_DESC; The Sindhian school of Hinduism emerged in 155 BCE following Menander's conquest of Sri Lanka. Many Indo-Hellenic reforms, rituals, and interpretations have been merged with the Hindu faith to create one of the largest state-run theological schools in India. Routine rituals and festivals are performed by an ordained member of the Vedic Brotherhood, and often resemble traditional Hindu rituals with a heavy Hellenic influence, in both practice and iconography. The Vedic Brotherhood was founded by Menander in an effort to subdue the local populace and further the Hellenization of India.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indoh_zor_DESC;The Pyromantic religion is actually composed by a combination of Hellenic mystery cults, fire worship based off a bastardised form of Zoroastrian rites and some hero-centric mythology. The biggest of these cults are the Pyraithoi. the "Priests of Fire", who arguably control the cult conglomerate under the auspices of the Ruler and maintain complicated rites of Pyromancy (divination through flames) at the High Temple of the Sacred Flame in Sistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indohelen_DESC;The Indo-Hellenic faith is a Local Graeco-Roman religion of Traditional soul. As the Greeks conquered Transoxiane and beyond, they brought their own belief system in these lands but also met new ones. When local princes did not favor one influence over the others, conquerors and commoners gradually integrated these new elements into the classical Hellenistic pantheon. Greeks were willing to acknowledge and in some cases even promote Indian deities they encountered in the northwestern subcontinent. While Buddhism, Hinduism, and Zoroastrianism have all had a sizeable influence on the development of the Indo-Hellenic religion, certain religions feature more prominently in various strains of this faith, and while some of these denominations may have cut ties and established a canon doctrine, the mainstream movement has maintained balance through the ever-changing times. The Hellenistic element remains dominant and aggregates all these elements: it not uncommon to see Zeus in presence of a both a Buddhist lion and the Hindu goddess Lakshmi in a single temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
irminsul_DESC;The worship of Irminsul is a Heretical German religion of Clerical soul. Irminsuls are great pillars made of holy trees which unite Earth and Sky, and through which the Divine can be approached, felt, and understood. Only the caste of priests is authorized to approach the Irminsul. During occult ceremonies held at irregular intervals, according to a calendar only known to those initiated, Wodanaz himself enters in communion with the Irminsul, communicates with the priests, and grants his protection to those who deserve it. It is said that Widukind was the only non-priest authorized to meet the greatest Irminsul just after defeating Charlemagne in 777 CE, when his spirit merged with the totems. The priests attending Irminsul enjoy a great authority over their communities. They accuse other Germanic beliefs which allow laymen to pray Wotan directly of being heretical, insulting to the Irminsul, and contrary to the essence of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
isis_DESC;A henotheistic Egpytian faith that centers it's cult around Isis, Mother Goddess and patroness of magic, but also recognizes and worships the other traditional Egyptian gods. Isis is also known as protector of the dead and goddess of children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jud_ark_DESC;A Judaic heresy that centers it's worship around using the Ark of the Covenant, or rather a replica of it, as a direct conduit to interpret the will of Yahweh. According to the Kebra Negast, the ethiopian "Book of the Glory of Kings", Menelik I brought the Ark to Ethiopia, but it was eventually lost. Adherents believe that when the true Ark is recovered, the connection with God will be restored and the Yehudim will return to their place as God's chosen people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jud_sabaoth_DESC;A heretical sect of Judaism following the emphasis on the existence of Yahweh as the Lord of Hosts, and that he shall grant his faithful victory against their enemies. It could be seen as a Jewish warrior cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jud_zion_DESC;Khawdash Siyun, or "Renewed Zion" is a heretic sect of Judaism that believes that Zion, the Land of Israel, is not in fixated piece of land, but in the Jewish people that carry it's will forward. Since the  people believe to be living in accordance with God, there is balance and happiness in the community not found in many other places. They seek to bring their message to all classes, from the lowest peasant to the highest king. According to tradition, it was founded by one of the lost tribes of Israel who settled between the White and Blue Nile;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
judaism_DESC;An Abrahamic religion off of which Christianity was based off of.

jumala_DESC;The monotheistic worship of Jumala, the Estonian version of the sky god in Suomenusko. All other gods do not exist, and Jumala is the one true god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jupiter_DESC;The monotheistic worship of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, the Greatest and Most Powerful. There is no god but Jupiter in this religion, and to declare any other is blasphemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kharijite_DESC;Kharijitism is a Heretical Islamic madhab of Populist soul. It constituted itself in First Islamic War in the 7th Century CE by opposing both Sunnis and Shias, and by assassinating Ali (whom they admired) because of his conciliatory attitude towards his enemy Muawiyah. Since then they have been rejecting - often violently - all forms of political leadership, citing the verse "No rule but God's." They denounce most forms of codified Islamic jurisprudence as a betrayal to God's message contained wholly in the Holy Qur'an, and consider it legitimate to kill a caliph if his acts are sinful. While sharing with other branches of Shia Islam a fascination for Ali, Kharijites violently reject the worship of individual imams and pilgrimages to imamzadeh as superstitions dangerously close to pagan idolatry. The strength of this uncompromising fundamentalist message based on Ali's legacy exercices a strong appeal among the Shias who regard their current leaders and clergy as corrupted by their drive for wealth and power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lugh_DESC;Lughism is a sect of the Celtic faith that worships mainly Lugh mac Ethlenn, the hero-deity of the Celts and king of the Tuath Dé ("tribe of the gods"). His followers seek to follow his example as a warrior hero-deity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
luwian_DESC;The Luwian faith is a Mainstream Archaic religion of Statist soul. The religious system is a legacy of the ancient Hittite civilization, who created a complex pantheon reflecting the mosaic of peoples present in Asia Minor, under the strong influences of Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. Many Gods co-exist with multiple identities, as a result of  successive layers of syncretism, products of the Anatolian melting-pot. Although each God has a specific area of responsibility, they are collectively responsible to guide mankind on the path of morale and piety. The traditional Luwian faith was more recently reformed when the client-king of Isauria, the long-standing Hittite heartland, conquered Constantinople with support from the Eastern legions and imposed himself as Emperor Leo III in 716 CE. He introduced the cult of the Luwian sun goddess Arinniti as the new inperial state religion: he proclaimed Sol to be the consort of Arinniti, and the Emperor to be her consort in the flesh. The subsequent decades saw a short-lived global supremacy of the imperial Luwian faith. Leo III conquered Rome and sacrificed the Western Emperor to Arinniti, imposing the Luwian faith to the entire Roman empire through well-organized persecutions of the Christians. The Luwian supremacy culminated when his son and successor Leo Constantine conquered Jerusalem and desecrated the Christian holy sites. Since then, in spite of the numerous set backs, the faithful still trust their divine connection to Arinniti under the leadership of Leo III's heirs, semi-divinised as the flesh of Arinniti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maher_DESC;A warrior cult focusing on the worship of Maher, the Sabean/Ethiopian god of war. Followers believe that by worshipping Maher, he will grant them victory in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
malakbel_DESC;The worship of Malakbel is a Local Archaic religion of Traditional soul. The meaning, in Aramaic, is “Messenger of Baal”: the worship of Malakbal is traditionally strongly associated with Beelshamen’s. In the first century, the Palmyran religion focused increasingly on the trio constituted by the supreme god Beelshamên, the lunar god Aglibôl, and the sun god Malakbêl. Then came the time of the glorious Palmyrene Empire in the 3rd Century. The Emperor Odaenathus and his wife Zenobia conquered Syria, the Parthian capital and Egypt, worshipping Beelshamen in an increasingly monotheist fashion as a reflection of their own absolute dominion of the lands of men. The new religious doctrine elevated Beelshamen as a rival of Sol Invictus, Ahura Mazda and Yahweh. In this evolving cult, the new Palmyrene State attempted to merge the personality of all lesser Gods, including Malakbel, in the overwhelming figure of Beelshamen. Sacrifices to Malakbel were forbidden; his statues and other representations, removed from the main temples. However, many lay people and lower clergymen, confused by these dramatic changes, continued addressing their prayers to Malakbel and made their best to keep some smaller representations for worship. Beelshameni nobles and high priests closed their eyes: as the Romans identified Malakbel with their own Sol Invictus, Beelshameni authorities viewed the cult of Malakbel as a potential vector for religious propaganda. More importantly, they did not perceive worshippers of Malakbel as open challengers of the Beelshamen supremacy, as made explicit by the God’s name itself. As the Empire collapsed and Palmyre returned to the status of petty kingdom, people nostalgic of the pluralist pantheon of old continued worshipping Malakbel with little opposition from the mainstream clergy. Through the figure of Malakbel, his followers worship the whole pantheon all lesser Gods threatened of oblivion and hope to maintain the ways of living of simpler times alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mand_ruha_DESC;The cult worship of Ruha d-Qudshai, the evil spirit allied with the Jewish Yahweh. The cult was founded by Kawus, the brother of the Sassanid emperor Khosrau I after hewas defeated by said brother in the Zoroastrian-Mazdakite civil war in 539 CE. Ruha d-Qudshai is regarded as the Holy Spirit in the Bible, Qur'an, and Torah, but in Mandaeism, she is regarded as an evil spirit responsible for the founding of Jerusalem and, with the help of her sons, the seven planets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandaean_DESC;Mandaean is a spiritually-influenced gnostic religion with a strongly-dualistic view. In Mandaeism, there are about nine features which are the fundamental tenets: 1) A supreme formless Entity, the expression of which in time and space is creation of spiritual, etheric, and material worlds and beings. Production of these is delegated by It to a creator or creators who originated in It. The cosmos is created by Archetypal Man, who produces it in similitude to his own shape. 2) Dualism is a strong feature of Mandaeism, with opposites in the cosmic universe such as Father and Mother, and Light and Darkness. 3) As a feature of this dualism, there are counter-types, a world of ideas. 4) The soul is portrayed as an exile, with home and origin being the supreme Entity to which the soul eventually returns. 5) Planets and stars influence fate and human beings, and are also places of detention after death. 6) A savior spirit or savior spirits which assist the soul on the journey through life and after it to 'worlds of light'. 7) A cult-language of symbol and metaphor. Ideas and qualities are personified. 8) 'Mysteries', i.e. sacraments to aid and purify the soul, to ensure rebirth into a spiritual body, and ascent from the world of matter. These are often adaptations of existing seasonal and traditional rites to which an esoteric interpretation is attached. In the case of the Na?oreans this interpretation is based upon the Creation story, especially on the Divine Man, Adam, as crowned and anointed King-priest. 9) Great secrecy is enjoined upon initiates; full explanation of the Creation Story, and the 'Mysteries' being reserved for those considered able to understand and preserve the gnosis. Marriage and procreation are a part of Mandaeism, and a strong emphasis on family life is placed. There is an abstention from strong drink and red meat, however. While Mandaeans reject Jesus of Nazareth, Abraham, and Moses, other characters from Abrahamic religions such as Adam, Abel, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Shem, Aram, and especially John the Baptist are highly revered. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mande_pagan_DESC;The Serer religion, or Fat Roog ("the way of the Divine") are the religious beliefs, practices and teachings of the Serer people of Senegal in western Africa. The Serer believe in a universal Supreme deity called Roog, but also worship the pangool (the spirits) and practise astronomy and cosmology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_DESC;A religion based on the teachings of Mani, a prophet originally from Persia. Similarly to Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism features a conflict between light and darkness. With Manichaeism, however, the conflict is mainly internal, and the struggle of good vs. evil is characterized by the struggle between Primal Man and Satan. It also plays out over the world, but things like the earth and the flesh are not seen as inherently good or evil, but rather possessed by light or darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_ahriman_DESC;A cult worshipping the Manichaean king of darkness, Ahriman, in an effort to bring about total darkness on the world. Followers of Ahriman seek to throw away the balance between shadow and light in the world and bring back the World of Darkness, the realm of their master, that existed since primordial times. They will fight zealously against all those who stand in their way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_germanic_DESC; A syncretic Germano-Manichaean faith. It features the traditional light vs darkness dualism element shown in all other Manichaean religions. The traditional Germanic focus on Wodanaz moves to a deity known as Auzawandilaz, "the luminous wanderer", who wages eternal war against the forces of the Muþspell, "the world destroyers". Their conflict is said to end in a cataclysmic event that will cover the world in flames, but thanks to Auzawandilaz humanity will endure and rebuild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_mithra_DESC;Theomachianism is a syncretic faith composed by many elements of Graeco-Roman mythology, Manichaeism, and Mithraism via its great success within the Roman military, turning to the idea that the world is the battleground of the Gods and that all life is part of the Battle between life and death, light and shadow, and that each mortal must give their all in the fight against the forces of darkness. Theomachians believe that all those who do not partake in their endeavour are servants of darkness and are to be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_slavic_DESC;Dragomirism is a Local Gnostic religion of Populist soul with a strong Slavic ascendant. Created by the Manichaean priest Dragomir in the latter half of the 9th Century CE, Dragomirism claims that the universe is an arena of eternal war between the Creator God (often identified with Rod) and the evil, chaotic dragon Zmey. Zmey is the creator of the material world, which he planned to use to corrupt the Creator God's pure divine creation. According to Dragomirist theology, humans are the only material beings possessing a soul - and as such are the only ones that can stand up against Zmey in this eternal struggle. Dragomirist beliefs incorporate the majority of Slavic pantheon - deities like Perun, Svarog and Dazhbog are lesser beings who attempt to harness Zmey's matter and turn it against its master. Dragomirists constitute small autonomous communities sharing all material properties, centered around the performing of esoteric rituals aiming at exorcising Zmey and bringing forth spiritual purity in this world. These Dragomirist communities are enthusiastic to fight Zmey's servants, but they often make for extremely unruly subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
marabout_DESC;A sect of Islam with the belief that true religious education and prosperity requires the use of a marabout (a religious teacher or leader). The marabout is often an expert on Islam and the Qur'an, and his followers adhere to him as they would to a prophet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
marcionist_DESC;Marcionism is a Local Christian creed of Scholarly soul, with strong Gnostic influences. Marcion of Sinope was a bishop who was living in Pontus during the times of early Christianity. Influenced by Gnostic dualist theory, he believed and taught that the wrathful Hebrew god Yahweh was a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament.  For Marcionists, Christ was not the Jewish Messiah but a spiritual entity that was sent by God to reveal the truth about existence, and thus allowing humanity to escape the earthly trap of the demiurge Yahweh. In spite of strong doctrinal opposition from the official Church, Marcionism remained predominant in the relatively isolated Pontus area, where it developed in isolation from other Christian currents. A particular feature of that creed is the development of a thorough alternative canon of scriptures, compiled even before the Catholic canonical Gospel. Believers emphasize the analysis of the Marcionist canon, composed of eleven books, which provide keys for analyzing this world in a moral, almost platonic perspective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mari_christ_DESC;Euskalism is a Local Christian movement of Traditional soul with a Barbarian ascendant. Euskalism is a hybrid religion focusing on the belief that the Virgin Mary was the incarnation of Mari, the goddess of the Euskal people. The movement developed in Euskalia as a local synthesis between Arianism and more ancient local beliefs. Believers follow many Christian beliefs and practices but put a heavy emphasis on the veneration of Mari (also equated with the Virgin Mary). Each village or community follows the spiritual directions of a virgin crone, often a kind of village elder, whose religious influence supercedes that of the standard Christian clergy. Traditionally, it is only the virgin crones who have the authority to select and give sacraments to Euskalist priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maturidi_DESC;An Islamic school of thought that broke off from the Ash'ari school, founded by Abu Mansur Al Maturidi. The main premise is that, contrary to Ash'ari ideology, belief (iman) does not change, but rather piety is what increases and decreases. Both the Ash'ari and Athari sects believe that iman does increase and decrease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdakism_DESC;A heresy of Zoroastrianism as brought about by Mazdak, a religious prophet. According to Mazdak, humanity should enjoy the pleasures of life and satisfy their appetite in the highest degree in regards to eating and drinking in the spirit of equality, as well as to aim at good deeds, abstention from causing harm to others, and practicing hospitality without reservation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
melkite_DESC;The Melkite Church is a Heretical Christian creed of Clerical soul. Melkites view themselves as the first Christian community, dating the Melkite movement back to the time of the Apostles. During the bitter debates occurring at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE, the official Church imposed its vision of a dual nature of the Christ. This declaration sparked tensions among Syriac Christians. The anti-Chalcedonians (mostly rural Syriac speakers) accused the Chalcedonians (mostly Hellenized urban dwellers) of following the Pope, or "king" (in Syriac, "malka"), and thus called them "Melkites". In the 8th century, when Leo III and his successor Leo Constantine organized violent persecutions against Christians, the Melkites negotiated relative respite for their communities by supporting the emperor's agents. The Pope had no choice but to excommunicate them, and the Melkite clergy in turn declared the church in Rome heretical while delivering those loyal to the Pope to the Imperium Romanum's persecution. This treason to their brothers in faith isolated the Melkite community, but allowed it to survive up to today in the midst of a hostile environment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mithra_DESC;A cult venerating Mithras, a Graeco-Roman diety based off the Zoroastrian divinity of covenant and oath, Mitra. Worshippers of Mithras have a complex system of seven grades of initiation, with ritual meals. Iconic scenes of Mithraic mythology include Mithras being born out of rock, him hunting and slaughtering a sacred bull with his bare hands and holding banquets with Sol. Very popular with the Roman soldiery, various military enclaves of the former Roman Empire now hold Mithraism as their state cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mithra_christ_DESC;A heretical sect of Mithraism which believes that Jesus of Nazareth was the incarnation of Mithra, "Mithras-Christos". It combines many Mithraic and Christian elements. But the core belief is that Christ is Mithra made flesh as Redeemer of the World. Mithraic-Christianity is very different in its message in that it is highly militant, the faithful believe in sacrificing themselves in "fighting evil" at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mithra_sol_DESC;Eosphorism is an union of Mithras and Sol into a new figure Eosphoros - The Dawn Bringer. Elements of the Judaeo-Christian tradition are also included, Eosphoros is Lucifer, and a direct Enemy of Christianity. Eosphorism sees the Dawn Bringer as the True God and Creator of Humanity, with Christianity being an abomination to be exterminated. It is a highly militaristic anti-Christian religion. Partly as a reaction against-Christianity, Eosphoros becomes Lucifer. Part of his mythology is centered around his Battle with Yahweh and Christ. He is the true Creator of Humanity and Redeemer, the Fallen God, rising again in the Morning. He overcomes Yahweh who is seen as an Opressor God, to help liberate humanity and bring Salvation. He is a Lord of Hosts, a Battle-Lord of the Morning, locked in battle with Yahweh, until his future victory and Redemption of Humanity in His Light. Followers believe that Eosphoros' light will bring harmony to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monophysite_DESC;Monophysitism is a Mainstream Christian denomination of Clerical soul. It is a byproduct of the theological School of Alexandria, which began its Christological analysis with the eternal Son, the Word of God made flesh, and sought to explain how this eternal Word had come to Earth as a man. Monophysites claim that, after the union of the divine and the human in the historical Incarnation, Jesus Christ, as the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, had only a single nature which was either divine or a synthesis of divine and human. Monophysitism was condemned by the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE, in which the Definition of Chalcedon, which maintains that Christ maintained one divine nature and one human nature after the Incarnation, was adopted. The Chalcedonian settlement encountered strong resistance in the Eastern fringes of the Roman Empire, leading ultimately to the schism of the Oriental Orthodox churches. The Monophysite Church took root where local kings were trying to differentiate themselves from the official Roman church, mainly in the Caucasus and Aegyptus. The Monophysite Church thrived and organised itself in these distant locations. Monophysites have developed their own rites and use clearly differentiated divine liturgies and iconographies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monothelite_DESC;A sect of Orthodox Christianity that believes that Jesus had two natures (one divine, one human) but one will. This is in contrast to the common belief that Christ had two wills and two natures, relatively corresponding to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
montanist_DESC;Montanism is a Heretical Christian sect of Clerical soul, with a heavy Graeco-Roman ascendant. Its founder Montanus, a mystic from Phrygia, launched a movement called "The New Prophecy" in the 2nd Century CE. This "New Prophecy" spread rapidly to other regions in the Roman Empire at a time when Christianity was not yet recognized or tolerated in the Western Empire. Montanus was a recent convert when he first began receiving revelation. He believed he was a prophet of God and asserted that New Jerusalem would appear in Phrygia. He insisted the Holy Trinity had precedence over Jesus, who he claimed was a mere initiator of his own prophecies. During his divinations, Montanus emulated the oracles of the Graeco-Roman world and spoke in the first person as God, claiming direct divine inspiration. Montanism remains a movement focused around prophecy, specifically the prophecies of the ininterrupted lines of "New Prophets", chosen at each generation by the Wise Amongst The Wise. These prophecies, formulated from the Montanist Oracle in Phrygia, are believed to contain the Holy Spirit's revelation for the present age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
murjiah_DESC;A school of Islamic thought that focuses on the idea that only Allah has the right to judge others, and that sin and "levels of believerhood" should not be such an important factor to Muslims, as Muslims should regard all other Muslims as believers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutazil_DESC;An Islamic school of theology based on reason and rational thought. There is an assertion that, because God is perfect and divine, the Qur'an must have been created and therefore cannot be co-eternal with God. From this premise, the Mu'tazili school of thought proceeds to posit that the injunctions of God are accessible to rational thought and inquiry: because knowledge is derived from reason, reason is the "final arbiter" in distinguishing right from wrong. It follows, in Mu'tazili reasoning; that "sacred precedent" is not an effective means of determining what is just, as what is obligatory in religion is only obligatory by virtue of reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neoplato_DESC;A monistic religion based around the teachings of Plato. Essentially, the beliefs include the belief in the One and Infinite, the source of all life in the universe. Since it is beyond the level of Being, it cannot be understood or comprehended, according to Plato. Since it is beyond Being, it is limitless, attribute-less, and magnitude-less. It is neither good nor bad, as morality would imply limitation. The One emanates nous, the perfect image of the One. This nous is simultaneously being and thought, and could be summarized by pure intellect. This is the highest level obtainable by man, and the nous corresponds perfectly to the One but is distinct and separate, as nothing reaches the level of the One. Under the One, there are three levels of celestial hierarchy: the Hypercosmic Gods, who make Essence, Life, and Soul, the Demiurge, known as the creator, and the Cosmic Gods, who make Being, Nature, and Matter. The last category would include the gods known in other pantheons. In a way, Neoplatonism is a philosophical religion with several pantheistic elements. There is no belief in an afterlife, but "salvation" (perfection and happiness) could be obtained through philosophical thought. There is no concept of evil, as it is comparable to darkness – which only exists in the absence of light. Good can be obtained through existence, which is complex in the sense that philosophical thought is the path to Good. Evil would exist without that, so ignorance would be Evil. The only "afterlife" per se that exists in Neoplatonism is the return to the Source (the One), essentially becoming part of the One. Impure souls would return to the Earth for a purification, which involves being reincarnated into a new body (human or animal). When a soul reaches the Source, they have achieved union with the universal cosmic soul and never need to return to Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nestorian_DESC;Nestorianism is a Mainstream Christian religion of Messianic soul, with strong Persian influences. It originates from the theological School of Antioch, which based its Christology on the human Jesus of the Gospels and sought to explain how this man had become united with the eternal Word in the Incarnation. Nestorius, the bishop of Constantinople in the 5th Century CE, emphasized the disunion between the human and divine natures of Jesus. The Church rejected these teachings and exiled him. Fleeing both the Church and the Eastern Emperor Imperator Alexandros X's persecutions against all sorts of Christians - heretical or not - Nestorius and his supporters relocated to Sassanid Persia. They affiliated with the local Christian community, which became increasingly Nestorian in doctrine. Persian scholars expanded on the teachings of Nestorius and his mentors, particularly after the relocation of the School of Edessa, a theological school of great importance to the Syriac speaking world, to the Persian city of Nisibis in 489 CE. Throughout the 6th Century, the church was frequently beset with internal strife and persecution from the Zoroastrians, and even experienced a schism it could hardly overcome. Eventually, the church emerged stronger after this period of ordeal, and increased missionary efforts in spite of complex relationships with the Persian rulers. Indeed, the Sassanid dynasty has developed a patronizing attitude to the Nestorians, seeing them as "good Christians" out of the realm of Lie, if yet not fully enlightened - a pragmatic doctrine which they used to gain support from their own Nestorian minority and impose Nestorianism as the leading Christian church, under strong control by the State. With the weakening of the Sassanid dynasty, the Nestorian church is now free from any form of State control. Nestorian clerics are convinced that a new golden age has arrived, and the Church has entered the 11th Century full of ambition and ready to unite the peoples of the East under the sign of the Cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_christ_DESC;Scandinism is a Local Norse religion of Statist soul, with strong Christian influences. Viking raids on Frankish kingdoms and the British Isles brought the Scandinavians in contact with Christianity. Some of the Forn Siðric rulers decided to formally embrace Christianity as they seek a broader source of legitimacy than the old tribal links. Thus Norse Christianity, or "Scandinism", respects the official Catholic Church as long as it does not mingle into its own business, while adapting its message to the specific Norse culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_pagan_DESC;The polytheistic religion of the Norse people. Many gods and goddesses are worshipped and venerated, and even though adherents may specialize their worship to a particular god or goddess, all deities in the pantheon are believed in. Practices include ancestor worship and remembrance, blots, and sacrifices -sometimes humans. Other mythological creatures, such as giants, dwarves, elves, etc. are also a part of this religion. There are also nine homeworlds which the followers believe the gods used to shape the world we live in today: Midgardr (land of the humans), Asgardr (land of the Aesir), Vanaheimr (land of the Vanir), Jotunheimr (land of the giants), Alfheimr (land of the elves), Hel (land of the dead), Svartalfaheimr (land of the dwarves), Niflheimr (land of ice), and Muspellsheimr (land of fire).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_war_DESC;Literally "Gods of War", the Ófriðartívar cult is an off-shooting branch of Norse mythology focusing on the veneration of the war gods of Norse legends: Odin, Tyr, and Freya, with a strong emphasis on their roles as mighty warriors. Adherents believe that if they worship these gods specifically, they will be granted victory in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orthodox_DESC;Orthodoxy is a Mainstream Christian religion of Statist soul. The principal belief, shared with all other Christian creeds, is that prophet Jesus of Nazareth, living in the 1st century CE, was the son of God who died on the cross and was resurrected to redeem the whole of humanity and deliver it from sin. Still, continous theological disputes fuelled by political divergences - about the nature of the Trinity and the Holy Spirit or organisation of the Church - have resulted in gradual splintering. The Pope Benedict VIII's preaching of a crusade against the Eastern Empire has resulted in the Great Schism of 1019 CE, when high Christian officials decided to support their Emperor rather than follow the Pope's call to revolt. This move has resulted in Orthodoxy severing all ties with the Roman Catholicism, an unprecedented division. The Eastern Roman Empire, although generally hostile to Christians, took the pragmatic step to support the institutionalization of the Orthodox Partiarchate in Orchid in order to limit the subversive influence of Rome's spiritual leadership over its own Christian population. Compared to Roman Catholicism, Orthodoxy has a much more sophisticated cult of sacred images ('icons'), a strong monastic movement with emphasis put on ascetic practices and a very decentralised internal organisation. While Roman Catholics follow the pope's authority, each Orthodox community has an autonomus patriarch, with the ecumenical patriarch considered to be first among the equals. Not having a strong independent church organisation, Orthodox patriarchs tend to rely on local rulers for material backing, and generally develop mutual legitimation relationships with relevant political authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
palmyran_pagan_DESC;The indigenous religion of the Canaanites. Elohimi is a polytheistic religion, with some monolastic (recognizing many gods, but worshipping one or a few) tendencies. The main gods of the Elohimi pantheon are Ba'al (the king of the gods), Attar (god of the morning star), Melqart (god of the underworld), Mawat (god of death);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
peckols_DESC;A cult worshipping the two deities of the underworld, Peckols and Patollo. The two are actually one god, formed in two separate entities. The god(s) is/are seen as an angry, evil spirit, known for haunting and taunting the living if the dead were not buried with proper rituals or if the living disobeyed the pagan priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pelagian_DESC;Pelagianism is a Heretical Christian religion of Clerical soul. Originating from the theology of the monk Pelagius in 380 CE, Pelagians hold that Adam never incurred any "original sin", only that he set a bad example for humanity. Consequently, humanity is not doomed to sin, but instead chooses to sin of its own free will. Therefore, the "original sin" did not taint humanity and mankind is capable of choosing right and wrong without need of divine aid. This belief directly opposes that of the Catholic Church, which claims that man is inherently evil and that man cannot come to God without the grace of God, symbolized by the Baptism. The Pelagian believers have their own well-structured clergy and are deeply convinced of the heretical nature of mainstream Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
perkunas_DESC;The polytheistic religion of the Baltic peoples, with the god of thunder, Perkunas, as the king of the gods. Dievas is also seen as a supreme god, but in the mainstream doctrine of Baltic paganism, Perkunas has a level of admiration that Dievas does not quite reach, mostly due to his rivalry with the devil. The devil, rather than a malevolent, all-encompassing, corrupting evil, is seen more as a trickster, stealing cattle and weapons, and then hiding in rocks and trees. When Perkunas comes to do battle, it is in the form of a thunder-storm, after which weapons and cattle are returned. Perkunas is also seen as the creator of weapons, or at least the concept of weaponry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
perun_DESC;The worship of Perun is a Mainstream Slavic religion of Martial soul. Perun is the creator and god of lightning, as well as ruler of the world. He is usually depicted as a tall man with a golden moustache, a silver head, a copper beard, and armed with a mighty axe. Under Nordic influences, most Slavs tend to grant him a loose prominence among all their Gods. The cult doesn't have established temples - believers convene at sacred oak woods, where they sacrafice oxen and other livestock. Perunic adherents believe he is also the god of light, fighting an eternal struggle against Veles - the god of underworld. It is said that whenever a lightning strikes, it was an attempt by Perun to kill Veles. Believers take it upon themselves to take part in this holy struggle againt Veles' servitors and other enemies to the Will of Perun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plato_christ_DESC;A hybrid-religion resulting from the meld of Christianity and Neoplatonist ideas. Emphasis could be on Jesus' existence as a Cosmic God, or perhaps God as one of the Cosmic Gods. Perhaps a similar take on Christ as featured in Porphyryanism, only more on the divinity of Christ rather than the rejection of Christianity altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plato_islam_DESC;A hybrid-religion resulting from the meld of Islam and Neoplatonist ideas. Emphasis could be on the inconceivability of the True Nature of God, as well as Mohammed's principles and writings in the Qur'an being taken as the path of the One, or even Allah being one of the Cosmic Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plato_pythagorean_DESC;A synthesis of Neoplatonism and the teachings of Pythagoras. There is a strong emphasis on the application of mathematics to the universe, both physical and spiritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
porphyryan_DESC;An anti-Christian sect of Neoplatonism founded by Porphyry of Tyre. Porphyry advocated that "the Gods have proclaimed Christ most pious, but the Christians are a confused and vicious sect", and as a result there is much disdain for Christianity in this sect of Neoplatonism. Porphyryans also practice vegetarianism on both spiritual and ethical grounds, under the belief that animals are as sentient as human beings, as enforced by mainstream Neoplatonism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
priscillian_DESC;Priscillianism is a Heretical Christian sect of Messianic soul, with a strong Gnostic influence. Priscillian was an Iberian ascetic mystic living in the fourth Century, who regarded the Christian life as continual intercourse with God. He created an ascetic group which thrived in spite of his execution for heresy. Its dualistic doctrine is based on the belief in the Kingdoms of Light and Darkness. Angels and men are from the Kingdom of Light and made from matter taken from God. Men received the mission to destroy the Kingdom of Darkness, but they fell and were imprisoned in human bodies. Thus both kingdoms are represented in men: the light by the Twelve Patriarchs which correspond to man's powers, and the darkness by the signs of the Zodiac and matter. Since the Twelve Patriarchs could not free man, Jesus was sent in a mortal body to release man from the curse of earthly matter. The salvation of man consists in liberation from the domination of matter, and at the center of Priscillianism is a strong call to a life of personal piety and asceticism, including celibacy, vegetarianism, and abstinence from alcohol.  This doctrine has always been under harsh repression from the mainstream Church, but the power of its ascetic message serves as the foundation for this deeply rooted sect. Priscillians do not attend churches integrated to villages and cities for their religious ceremonies, as most other Christians do. Instead, Priscillan priests organize religious and social life within the confine of a network of impregnable fortresses, which they initially developed to resist repression and invasions. Within the austere stone walls, they impose tenuous ascetic practices on themselves and their community, requiring extreme self-control in a spiritual as well as physical sense. These practices are based as much on studies of the secret scriptures as on stern training in the arts of war and murder in the name of the Christ of Light. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
qarmatian_DESC;A fanatical sect of Islam under the idea that a utopian Islamic republic could be formed. Vegetarianism is also one of the major practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ragnarok_DESC;The Ragnarökic cult focuses it's worship on Fenrir - the wolf destined to devour Odin - and his sons, Hati and Skoll. The Ragnarökic see the Aesir as gluttonous corrupts and the Vanir as debauched revellers. They believe that during the end of time, the Ragnarök, Fenrir will devour the Aesir, the Vanir and their corrupt realms of Ásgarðr and Vanaheimr and afterwards rule the renewed Miðgarðr with those that stood by his side, purged of the tainted influence of the Aesir and Vanir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rod_DESC;The worship of Rod is a local variation of the Slavic religion of traditional soul. Rod is the oldest Slavic deity, the creator of the universe and all other gods. Even though Nordic influence resulted in some Slavs accepting Perun as a chief deity, more traditional tribes still worship Rod the Creator, as they did centuries ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
roman_imperial_DESC;A state cult focused around the veneration of former rulers of prominence, specially prevalent in the remaining Roman enclaves. Important historical Roman figures like Megas Alexandros, Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar are officially venerated as deities, offered sacrifices to, and considered "patrons of the state". Other important local figures might be also venerated alongside the generally accepted great rulers. The priesthood is highly organized under a a Pontifex Maximus who regulates all the worship and sacrifices to these "deities" under the auspices of the ruler, who is also considered divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sabellianist_DESC;A heretical sect of Christianity founded by Sabellius, whose doctrine states that God is one indivisible being and the forms of Jesus and the Holy Spirit were both outward manifestations of God as he chose to appear to mankind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
saule_DESC;A sun-worshipping religion variant based off of Baltic paganism, in which Saule, the sun god, is worshipped in a monotheistic fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
semipelagian_DESC;Semipelagianism is a Local Christian creed of Clerical soul. It was developed as a compromise between Pelagianism and the teachings of the Church. Pelagianism opposes mainstrean Catholicism by stating that mankind is capable of choosing right and wrong without need of divine aid, while Catholicism teaches that man cannot come to God without the grace of God. The Semipelagian compromise states that beginning of faith is free will, but the growth of faith is God's work. This is contrary to the common Catholic belief at the time that the beginning of faith requires an initiative from God, but the rest is free will. Thus, according to Catholicism, no one can merit the initial grace of forgiveness associated with conversion, as Semipelagians attempt to convey. In practice, Semipelagian communities have their own well-structured clergy and their rites have evolved in a distinct way, although they are not as radical as Pelagians in opposing mainstream Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
set_DESC;A Egyptian sect that worships Sutekh, also known as Set, the god of the desert storms and disorder. The sect flourished during the oppressive reign of an Atenist ruler. The followers of Sutehk seeked to topple the corrupt Atenist leadership and bring about a renewed world born from the red sands. Their power has dwindled since Atenism's influence was reduced, but a few still cling on to carry on the will of their deity. He has a positive role in the traditional Egyptian faith where he is employed by Ra on his solar boat to repel the serpent of Chaos Apep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sethian_DESC;The Sethoitae ("followers of Seth") are a Local Gnostic cult of Traditional soul, with significant Jewish influences. According to the Sethoitae mythos, the material world was created by the demiurge Yaldabaoth, who in turn was a creation of Sophia - an emanation of the Only God's wisdom. Yaldabaoth has created the Earth, assisted by his subordinates - the Archons - and tricked mankind into believing he is the Only God. His greatest creation is Adam and Eve's third son - Seth - who unwittingly inherited divine powers Yaldabaoth had stolen from Sophia. According to Sethians, Jesus of Nazareth was Seth's reincarnation, and his earthly mission was to reunify human souls - particles of Light dispersed in the world - with the divine world called Pleroma. Since the Light is timeless and eternal, Sethians cherish tradition, upholding ceremonies and beliefs described in the scriptures. They are steadfastly orthodox, considering every change as yet another corrupted creation of Yaldabaoth, aimed to retake the divine powers Seth inherited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shams_DESC;A sect of the Arabo-Semitic faith that venerates Shamash, the Semitic sun god. This cult is the modern descendant of the ancient Babylonian and Assyrian cult of Shamash, and maintains it's strict priesthood. Priests are responsible for continuing the cultural and religious traditions of their city-states, and are viewed as mediators between humans and Shamash. The priesthood resides full-time in temple complexes, and administers to matters of state including the large irrigation processes necessary for civilization's survival, thus they have a high degree of control and autonomy from the ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shiite_DESC;Another major sect of Islam, differing from Sunni Islam in the belief that caliphates should be led by purified members of Muhammad's direct lineage. Practices also differ, largely in the prayer stone they use (following the belief that prayer should be closer to something naturally from the Earth, rather than a manufactured rug).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slavic_christian_DESC;Slavic Christianity is a Local Christian creed of Clerical soul, with strong Barbarian influences. Increasing influence of the Solar religions among Slavic peoples motivated the Catholic Church to pay due attention to this group of people emerging as the power broker of the distant eastern lands. The Pope sent twelve clerical envoys with a strong escort and lavish gifts to make their way to the eastern edge of the world for the sake of meeting, impressing, and converting the king of the Slavs. For three years, no news came to Rome from the Papal embassy. Eventually, an Audianist merchant from Caffa brought one of the chests back with the heads of eleven of the envoys. No more was heard from the Slavs for twenty-nine years, until a delegation came presenting themselves as envoys of the Bishop of the Holy Church of the Slavs. How the last of the twelve envoys could succeed is not clear, but a semiautonomous Christian church for the Slavs emerged. It first organized itself underground, without support from any ruler or the rest of Christendom. As a result, the Slavic clerics have started creating am organized clergy of their own, somwhow replicating the early Christian days when the Church had to hide from the Roman State.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slavic_pagan_DESC;The polytheistic religion of the Eastern Slavs, in which Rod is seen as the creator god and therefore the king of the gods; although in some groups, Svarog is worshipped as the principal deity. Other deities include Perun (god of thunder), Veles (god of the underworld), Jarilo (goddess of the moon), Dažbog (god of the sun), and so forth. Rituals include festivals throughout the year, namely seasonal festivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_DESC;The Solar-Imperial cult is a Mainstream Graeco-Roman religion of Statist soul. The central figure of the cult is Sol Invictus ("Invincible Sun"), incarnated in flesh as the Imperator of the Imperium Romanum. As such, the Imperator is percieved as a divine figure, having unquestionable authority in every matter, be it secular or spiritual. Since its introduction by Imperator Commodus in the 2nd Century CE, Solar-Imperialism became one of the most widespread and influential religions of the world, influencing religious systems from Britannia and Scandinavia all the way to Ethiopia. Two of the most distinguishing practices of the Sol-Imperial cult are the celebration of the 25th of December (Dies Natalis Sol Invictus - "Day of Invincible Sun's Birth") and the practice of "going into the desert" - a practice in which the aging emperor abdicates the throne in favour of his heir, so that the new Sun would rise once the old one sets. Still, peaceful transitions of power are rather unheard of - with most emperors either slain in battle or murdered by palace plotters, only a few actually left Constantinople to die peacefully in the arid wastelands of the Sahara. The central temple of Sol Invictus - the Hagia Sophia of Constantinople - is the greatest sacral building of the known world, dwarfing even the most majestic Islamic sanctuaries and the tallest Zoroastrian Temples of Fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_apollo_DESC;A Hellenic version of the worship of Sol Invictus, only with Apollo being the monotheistic god in focus. Unlike with Solar-Imperialism, followers of Apollo-Helios do not believe any emperor is Apollo-incarnate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_boreas_DESC;Apollo-Boreas is the union of Apollo, the sun god, and Boreas, the northern wind god, The Devouring One. Boreas was adopted as a patron by the Bosporan Kings - as a cruel unforgiving God he complements the benevolent side of Apollo - together they form a two-faced God reveling in the duality of good and evil. In the first half of the year, the Apollo facet is venerated for his warmth and the other half, Boreas is offered sacrifices to stave off the cold of winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_christ_DESC;Solar-Christianity is a Heretical Graeco-Roman religion of Statist soul, with significant Christian influences. Established in the 4th Century CE and popularised during the reign of Imperator Alexander VII, Solar-Christianity claims that the Christian prophet Jesus of Nazareth is the only true Sun incarnate and the son of God. While it does share basic elements with other Christian creeds, its pagan elements (such as the adaptation of Dies Natalis Sol Invictus as central holiday, or the personality cult of the Imperator as Christ's sole successor) make other Christian creeds treat their Solar brethren with suspicion and caution. While moderate Solar-Christians are usually tolerated by followers of the Invincible Sun, more radical elements tend to openly challenge the authority of the Imperators, seeing them as mere usurpers to Christ, who is to return during the Day of Judgement to purge the Earth of all evil. Solar-Christian monarchs enjoy undisputed authority - which stems from the Solar component, supported by Saint Augustine's theory of Civitas Dei (City of God) - according to which a strong secular state is required to protect the faithful from evil until the Day of Judgement comes and a pure Kingdom of God is created.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_islam_DESC;Al-Shams Islam is a Local Islamic sect of Statist soul, with strong Graeco-Roman influences. When Muawiya established control over the lands conquered by the Muslims, he found the wide array of spiritual affiliations present in Judea (the crossroad of empires) both a liability and an opportunity. Challenged by both heathens and the first divisions within Islam, which were encouraged by covert Roman actions, he reacted by blurring the lines of division between all the religions under his control. Making only vague references to Muhammad as the first among a lineage of God's messengers, he controlled tightly the emerging clergy, stopped the codification of Islam into canon holy texts and established himself as the only "Commander of the Faithful." His spiritual message, garbed in typically Roman monarchical allure, combined ambiguously Muhammad's oral legacy with Manichaean and Solar components so as to establish himself as the rallying point of all sects persecuted in the Roman and Sassanid empires, while reuniting the Muslim faithful. Many of his senior advisors were open worshipers of Sol Invictus. Later on, Umayyad caliphs would finally establish a more formal and less tolerant form of Islam. Under the influence of an increasingly powerful clergy, some within the realm of Islam - particularly in the deserts of Palestine around Nabatea where various heretical sects thrived far away from civilization - refused the new orthodox Qur'an and interpretation of the Prophet's life as innovations made up by strangers from the genuine Muslim community to justify their own bide for power. Mu'awiya's offspring, excluded from the palace politics in Damascus but still strong in Nabatea, seized the opportunity and referred to him as both heir of Muhammad  and the reincarnation of Alexandros XV (martyred during the Muslim siege of Alexandria, and whose return was expected by various Solar and Solar-Christian sects). In this double legacy, the true message of the Solar God, as revealed first to Muhammad, was made clear: all the empires of men but the Realm of the Faithful will be brought to dust by the burning wrath of God, and believers should follow the holy lineage stemming from Muawiya. In many aspects, the key beliefs of Al-Shams Muslims appear, to be paradoxically consistent with the Qur'an as codified by their Sunni enemies, but yet they follow a radically different interpretation of the holy text, emphasizing the Solar elements in Allah and his Word, minimizing the importance of Muhammad, refuting all hadith and the location of the Muslim holy cities in Hijaz. Refusing to lay down the Solar God's holy message in writing, they instead worship their Monarch, Son of the Sun, Shadow of God on Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_mani_DESC;A hybrid-religion that worships Sol Invictus as the God of Light in Manichaean fashion, fighting against Ahriman, the king of darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_norse_DESC;The worship of Odin-Sol is a Local Norse cult of Statist soul, with strong Graeco-Roman influences. Increasing contacts with the Roman Empire by Varangian captains led to a sythesis between the traditional Nordic deity Óðinn with the Roman cult of Sol Invictus. This synthesis makes Óðinn-Sól a patron of rulers, associated with victorious conquests and wise administration alike. The chief attribute of Óðinn-Sól is his single eye, representing the solar disc. It is said that Óðinn sacrificed his other eye to gain infinite wisdom, so that he can shine upon the world for only half of a day. Another chief belief is the so-called Ragnarök ("Twilight of the Gods") when the forces of darkness would rise against the Sun, and the next world would be born anew from the ashes of the previous. Solar eclpses are of particular importance for the followers of Óðinn-Sól, for  they believe that during each eclipse the forces of darkness attempt to strike against the Solar deity, only to be thwarted by Óðinn-Sól's divine power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_sahara_DESC;This religion belongs to the Fur migrants who settled in the area west of the Nile. Legend has it that while moving in the desert, the early Fur in the area came across pale-skinned men in ornate dress who appeared to be dying of thirst. When provided with aid, they said that they were tasked with escorting the Sun Emperor - whom they called "Sol Invictus" - into the desert as per their servitude to their Lord Made Flesh. They also said that he will return one day to rule forever. Basically, the nomads were fascinated by these strange light-skinned men and believed them to be celestial servants of this Sol Invictus. The men were revered by the tribe and essentially treated comparable to saints. As time and generations went on, light-skinned people became more and more familiar to the Fur and obviously they were no longer thought of as celestial beings, but rather held the place of the first missionaries to the Fur in spreading the will of Sol Invictus, and the initial men that were encountered are still regarded as messengers of Sol Invictus that were meant to be found by the Fur. This religion is not the same as Solar-Imperial because they do not recognize the validity of the current emperor, for they  believe that the true Sun Emperor will return one day, and all others are either imposters or placeholders until his return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_slav_DESC;The worship of Hors is a Local Slavic religion of Statist soul, with significant Graeco-Roman influences. Hors is the Slavic sun god, a personification of the solar disc. According to the mythos, Hors travels across the sky at day and moves underground at night, fighting off the monsters living there. One common Horsic belief is that red sunrises are caused by blood split by Hors during his noctural journey. Hors is interpreted as source of all light and life in the world - although the creation itself is usually attributed to Rod. Roman influence has resulted in partial association of Hors with Sol Invictus - each ruler is enthroned during sunrise, with prayers and offerings being made to Hors, protector of the realm. Additionally, the ruler is considered to have a special relationship with Hors, giving blessings on the god's behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_tsahay_DESC;An Ethiopian heresy based on Solar-Imperialism, in which Mahrem, the sun god and god of war, is worshipped in a monotheistic fashion. Much like in Solar-Imperialism, the ruler claims direct descent  from him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

solomonic_christ_DESC;Solomonic Christianity is a Local Christian sect of Statist soul, with significant Archaic influences. The Ethiopian Church, although Christian, evolved under the prophetic rule of the Solomonid dynasty. It retains a stronger emphasis on the Old Testament and even integrates some elements from the Arabo-Sabaean religions, where ancient gods are merged with Biblical Prophets. Solomon is specially commemorated as a prophet almost the equal of the Christ, with the title of "Righteous Prophet and King". King Solomon seduced the Queen of Saba, herself descendant of Almaqah, the Sabaean sun god, and sired her son, Menelik I. He became the first Emperor of Ethiopia and brought the Ark of the Covenant, with divine assistance, to Ethiopia. The Solomonid dynasty, claiming descent from Solomon and the Queen of Sheba through Menelik I, thus perpetuates the rule of the House of David. Solomonic Christians believe the Solomonid dynasty and their state to be of divine nature, and see themselves as God's chosen people - the only legitimate perpetrators of the Alliance of the Old Testament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

svaroh_DESC;The worship of Svarog is a Local Barbarian religion of Statist soul, with significant Graeco-Roman influences. Svarog is the god of the celestial fire and blacksmithing, preserver of the holy fire which brought men out of the Stone Age.

svetovid_DESC;A warrior cult following the worship of Svetovid. Svetovidans believe that worship of Svetovid will bring them victory in battle, as with most warrior cults. Svetovid is seen as some as another form of Perun, but is not seen as the same being (by most, anyway). Key elements in this cult include divination, symbolism (usually involving a white horse, an image of Svetovid with a sword or bow in one hand and a drinking horn in the other, and idolatry involving pillars and offerings. There is also a Temple of Svetovid located on the island of Rujan, where a statue of Svetovid with four heads is located, and a horn of abundance is filled with fresh mead every year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
talab_DESC;A monolastic sect worshipping Ta'lab, the moon god. Since most travel was done at night, when it is cool, the moon plays an important role in the life of the people of the Arabian Peninsula. This sect though, has taken this a step forward: the sun god Almaqah is the unforgiving ruler of the heating Arabian day and his light searing, thus, they have fanatically set to bring about the eternal night where only the moon of their deity rules the skies alone. The followers of Ta'lab have a special enmity with the Almaqahi priesthood who exiled them out of Saba long ago, when the cult of Almaqah was fully established as the state religion of the kingdom of Saba. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tarhunt_DESC;The worship of Tarhunt is a Local Archaic religion of Martial soul. At the time of the reformation of the Luwian faith by the Isaurian emperor Leo III in the 8th century, frontier areas of the client-kingdom of Isauria followed a slightly different interpretation, originating from their long experiences of defending their realm against the threat of assertive neighbors. While recognizing the Sun Goddess Arinniti, they focus their attention on Tarhunt, the god of sky and storm, holding a triple thunderbolt and a double-headed axe, slayer of the evil dragon Illuyanka. Worshippers of Tarhunt consider themselves as the holiest of all Luwian, the first line of defense of their ancient civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tengri_ahriman_DESC;The Ahriman-Tenrilists believe that the world is a battle between two forces - their particular side being that of Ahriman-Tengri. They believe that the world was created to be a battleground where they must prove their worth by striving for power, destroying their enemies, and also believe that the world is flawed and corrupted by the Great Opponent, the patron of decadent civilizations, and it is their belief that it should be remade and reforged in blood. They believe that the blood of their enemies feeds the sky and gives power to Ahriman-Tengri. The most zealous amongst them also believe that "if the sky is a desert, so should the world below be". To do this they conquer it and purge it of all those who would not bow to Tengri-Ahriman. They believe in the merciless extermination of their enemies, the purging of weakness, and continuous striving for power. Their greatest kings are considered to be incarnations of Ahriman-Tengri..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

To oversee and guide his creation, he has given a mandate to the rightful Prince, whose duty it is to unite the known world under Rod-Tanri's glorious rule. The Rod Tanrili faith has a simple clergy system, featuring priests who mostly tend to congregation members and shrine maintenance, and shamans, who perform mystical rites to gain access to a higher plane of existence from where they can consult Rod Tanri himself on how best to fulfill his holy wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unctionist_DESC;Unctionism is Local Christian religion of Statist soul. The Capetian kings of Francia elevated the sanctity of kingship to the point where the king and a council of the bishops of the realm supplant the role of the Pope. This royal supremacy is symbolized during coronation. Like with the kings of the Old Testament, the coronation ceremony is the covenant between God and the Capetian sovereign: in exchange for divine unction by holy oil, the king promises to reign with justice, to protect his people, and to uphold the faith. This alliance took tangible form with the Sainte Ampoule, or Holy Flask. The Sainte Ampoule was brought to Saint Remi by a dove sent by God for the baptism of Clovis I, the first Frankish king to convert to Christianity. It gets miraculously refilled by God every time for each coronation of a true king, demonstrating the direct relation between God and the Frankish royal line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
valentinian_DESC;Valentinianism is a Local Gnostic sect of Scholarly soul, with a strong Christian ascendant. Valentinus was an early Christian gnostic theologian living in the 2nd Century CE who founded his own school in Rome when he failed to be selected for the bishop of Rome. The Valentinian theological system is extremely complicated and is kept secret to infidels. In the beginning, there was a Plemora (fullness) in which there was the Father. The Father projected thirty Aeons which joined into 15 syzygies, among them being Sophia (wisdom). Her curiosity and passion led to her fall from the Plemora and the creation of the world and man. Man must now recognize the Father as the true source of divine power in order to achieve gnosis, or knowledge. Only individuals of a spiritual nature (those following the truth revealed by Valentinus) can received the gnosis alloweing them to return to the divine Pleroma, while those of a psychic nature (the rest of the Christians) can only attain a lesser form of salvation, and that those of a material nature (non-Christian infidels) are doomed to perish. Valentinians devote much time studying their esoteric, complicated texts in order to achieve gnosis in this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vattisenyaly_DESC;The traditional religion of the Chuvash people, also known as "the old ways".

waldensian_DESC;Waldensianism is a Local Christian movement of Populist soul. Forming in response to what their perceived growing corruption in the Catholic Church, Waldensians refuse authority from the established clergy and princes. Instead, they take model on the original fathers of the church, when small Christian commmunities organized themselves in clandestinity with a large degree of autonomy but a strong sense of a shared community.  The Waldensians focus their doctrine on four main tenets: 1) oaths to anyone but God are to be forbidden, 2) capital punishment should not be allowed by any civil power, 3) sacraments given by unworthy priests are invalid, and 4) any layman who lives a Christ-like life may consecrate the sacrament of the altar. As a result of these rules and their rejection of established authority, Waldensians constitute self-ruled communities with anarchical tendancies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Zoroastrians despise any sort of chaos, and believe any god that would demand their followers to spill undue blood is an agent of the Destructive Spirit, Angra Mainyu. The Zoroastrian clergy is held in very high regard by the faithful, as they are tasked with preserving the most important truths of the universe from the lies of Angra Mainyu.

mari_christ_reformed_DESC;The Marianist Church is an effort to codify and doctrinalize all the existant Virgin Mary-centric Christian cults. The references to the Basque goddess Mari have been all but erased from formal liturgy and scriptures, for the faith to be more acceptable to non-Basques for conversion. The tradition of consulting virgin crones and the clergy have been fused into one: in a strange aversion of normal Christian orthodoxy, Marianist priesthood places greater emphasis on the women's role in the priesthood, while men are allowed to have minor, non-administrative positions. While the ruler is the official head of the Church, chosen by the Virgin Mary, every action related to the Church has to be sanctioned by the Marianist Clergy, so it's not clear who truly holds the power in the Church. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdakism_reformed_DESC;The namesake of the Desnadi religion - the Desnadi itself, a series of religious tales said to have been written by Mazdak long ago - becomes the official scripture of the Mazdakite religion. A returned emphasis on Light and Dark and the Good/Evil dichotomy characterizes this reformed Zoroastrian religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
montanist_reformed_DESC;The Phrygian reformation is characterized by a religious head who interprets the readings of oracles as well as organized scripture to help them do so. The prophecies of Phrygius will be fulfilled and his Light will be spread!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
muslim_aliite_reformed_DESC;This sect of Islam claims direct descendance from the prophet Muhammad and are thus closest to Allah (in their eyes). They view themselves as the 'Leaders of the Faithful' and go to great lengths to further their legitimacy through conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
muslim_domination_reformed_DESC;The followers of the Mujahid sect focus their efforts on fighting the enemies of pure Islam - real or otherwise. Particular emphasis is placed on the domination of other faiths through the struggle of jihad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
muslim_sufi_reformed_DESC;This sect of Islam focuses on the importance of Islamic jurisprudence as underlined by the early Islamic philosopher Al-Shafi'i. It emphasizes proper istinbaat (derivation of laws) through the rigorous application of legal principles as opposed to speculation or conjecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_christ_reformed_DESC;Kristatrú goes further than the Scandianist faith in that it reemphasizes veneration of most Norse gods as saints under Christ who is merged with Odin to form one Great Allfather.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_pagan_reformed_DESC;The reformed Norse Pagan faith has a Holy Book written in runes with chapters on Creation, the gods, Ragnarok, and secret spells - 'galdrs'. The church has a standardized liturgy and a formal church hierarchy led by the Fylkir, who - much like an Islamic Caliph - is both a secular ruler and the religious leader of the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
northern_sun_reformed_DESC;Sehuli is a Solar reformation of several religions that previously syncretized paganism and sun worship. Sun gods of respective faiths are elevated into a monotheistic worship fashion: these range from the Germanic Sunna to the Baltic Saule, but all are seen as the reincarnation of Sehul, the primal god of the sun. Hundreds of years of syncretism and evolution have led the barbaric north into the warm shining Light!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
priscillian_reformed_DESC;The great fortresses of the Priscillans have been replaced by holy words. To spread the teachings of Priscillas the teachings themselves were diluted: the extreme dark/light dichotomy is lessened and holy soldiers viewed with less admiration. The Apologetics no longer believe that the battle between light and dark will be fought on the battlefield, but instead will be fought in the hearts and minds of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ragnarok_reformed_DESC;The Røkkatrú religion expands its focus from not only Fenrir and his sons to all underworld gods. In the times of Ragnarok, the Aesir and Vanir - the ones who ruled the earth - would be anihilated. Only the underworld would be spared and thus these gods were the only ones deserving of worship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
serer_reformed_DESC;The reformed Fat Roog (the will of Roog) religion is an organized version of Serer paganism suitable for doctrinization and proselytization, with a single religious scripture including a creation myth, totem animal fables and chapters on the lesser spirits under Roog. The church also has a standardized liturgy and a formal priestly hierarchy under the ruler, who is seen as the protector of Roog's faith in Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
set_reformed_DESC;The reformed cult of Set has come full circle; in an effort to emulate their previous Atenist oppressors, all other gods are removed from the pantheon entirely. There is only Set the All-Knowing and All-Powerful, Lord of the Sands of Death and the Afterlife. May the Sun's rays tremble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sethian_reformed_DESC;The reformation of gnosticism changed the tenets of the religion very little: Seth is still viewed as the savior and Jesus his reincarnation. However, some particularly holy priests are given the distinction of being the 'closest to Seth' and govern religious affairs. May all the Light of the World be one under Seth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slavic_christian_reformed_DESC;The Slavic Christian's strength has consumed the pagan enemies surrounding it. With no need for underground worship any longer numerous elements of the church Slavic Christianity was derived from seep back in: a religious head - similar to a Pope - and church worship to name a few.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slavic_pagan_reformed_DESC;In the reformed Slavianist religion Rod is given total authority over all other gods which become more akin to saints than divine beings. A codified set of myths frame Rod as the fountain that begets all the gods and all the things existing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_boreas_reformed_DESC;As the Apollo-Boreasean religion evolved Boreas was given more and more power at the expense of Apollo. In Septentrionism Boreas has become the god of both good and bad tidings: Apollo is merely a messenger of Boreas's good tidings. Bad tidings are sent by figures like Notus and Zephyrus - the other wind demigods. The North Wind blows fierce and proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_islam_reformed_DESC;The vaguely Islamic sect of Muawiya has reformed and has become far more similar to the Imperial Solar religion of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Qur'an is cherrypicked for justification of the heirs of Muawiya, and Muawiya's heirs themselves are seen as reincarnations of Sol Invictus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_sahara_reformed_DESC;The Dìwwokoan religion belongs to the Graeco-Roman Civilization, characterized by a strong interest in civic matters and well-organized military. It has a Barbarian Ascendant, characterized by an emphasis on rural areas, individual martial prowess, and low division of labor. Its Doctrine is Mainstream: it is recognized as one of the main doctrinal systems in its most legitimate form. Its Soul is Statist: the faith is strongly infused with legitimation rethorics supporting political power, as the religion is instrumentalized by the Prince to strengthen its hold on society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tarhunt_reformed_DESC;Tarhuntism takes the glory and power of the thunder god even further: He not only defeated Illuyanka but in fact had to fight all the other gods for supremacy and has emerged as the one surviving deity. Tarhuntism rejects both the darkness of Illuyanka and the light of Arriniti - the thunder and lighting have vanquished both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
teiwaz_reformed_DESC;The reformed worship of Teiwaz, Rextaz Siduz ("the Law Custom") becomes more dualistic with the inclusion of Teiwaz's father, Hymir. Teiwaz continues to be venerated as the god of law and honor, but his father is seen as a figure of destruction and chaos - both are needed for Germania to triumph over its oppressors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tengri_bud_reformed_DESC;Datsanism places great significance on the education of its adherents through the use of dazans, or small monastic universities. Monks and populace alike become more and more educated in the ways of both religion and medicine and the Light begins to shine from the unlikeliest of places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tengri_mani_reformed_DESC;The Great Birch Tree, Bai-Ulgan, is dualistically worshipped alongside Tengri by the Mani-Tengri followers. The Great Blue Sky and Great Green Tree together create the light needed to fill the void and banish the darkness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tengri_pagan_reformed_DESC;The reformed Tengriist faith has a formal scripture with writings on the will of Tengri, the spirits,the void, and secret shamanistic rituals. The church has a standardized liturgy and a formal church hierarchy led by the High Shaman who, much like an Islamic Caliph, is both a secular ruler and the religious leader of the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tengri_rod_reformed_DESC;Rodism is a reformed Tengriist faith and places Tengri himself on the sidelines to further worship of Rod. An established scripture places Rod distinctly above Tengri, who is closer to mortals than Rod himself; while Rod is in the heavens, Tengri resides in the sky, between the heavens and earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vattisenyaly_reformed_DESC;Compared to its predecessor, the Sardashi faith is characterized by regular and organized prayer lead by a priest-warrior caste. While the religion has remained polytheistic there is increased focus on Sarat, the Sun. Even in the cold, dark north, the Light finds its way in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
voipel_reformed_DESC;In the reformed Voipel'ean faith, hate for civilizations is replaced by a tempered admiration. The long night and cold winter will forever exist but someday the sun will rise and shine bright over the Cold North!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
yazdanism_reformed_DESC;Yârsânism is an advanced syncretic evolution of Yazdânism in which the universe is composed of two distinct yet interrelated worlds: the internal and the external, each having its own order and rules. Although humans are only aware of the outer world their lives are governed according to the rules of the inner world. Among other important pillars of their belief system are that the Divine Essence has successive manifestations in human form and the belief in transmigration of the soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zande_pagan_reformed_DESC;The Mbambui religion belongs to a Barbarian Civilization, characterized by an emphasis on rural areas, individual martial prowess, and low division of labor. Its Doctrine is Mainstream: it is recognized as one of the main doctrinal systems in its most legitimate form. Its Soul is Martial: heroic deeds on the battlefield are glorified as the finest sign of holiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zor_angra_reformed_DESC;The reformed religion of Angra Mainyu resembles the other darkness-worshipping cults but differs in that the world's dualism is far less important to the religious elite. The dark-light conflict exist but just isn't as important as the worship of Angra Mainyu himself and the development of great temples to his worship. After all,darkness can very well be a beacon of its own in a world of corrupt light...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zurvanism_reformed_DESC;Zurvanism has advanced in its quest to understand creation. While Zoroastrians believe in the creation of the universe from nothingness by Ahura Mazda the believers of Ptâ Zrvânahê believe that 'anything' cannot be created from nothing and such things as heaven, hell, reward, and punishment simply do not exist. Ahriman? Zurvan himself? Fabrications of the mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
