DAMO209TP;Your faithful councillor receives an earnest letter.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO209OPTADESC;I am ever at your service, mistress.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

DAMO222EVTDESC;Although the [This.Spouse.GetOnlyDynastyName] retainers were initially suspicious and hostile, before long they were unable to reconcile the rumors of your odiousness with the evident fact of your chivalrous nature and impressive stature.
